Hi, I'm Will. You may know me as *marzella* [[Who is this guy?|that]] fella. Currently wandering the earth in search of adventure. 


### You are here

The Ronin Repository.

A haven for acquiring, using and [[Work with the garage door up|sharing]] my ever-evolving [[pattern language]] for life.

*It's an interconnected set of solutions to common problems*.

In doing so, I strive to enhance my thinking, foster continuous learning, and fuel my creativity.

But also, it's something I hope to leave behind for my children: [[Storytelling is how we ultimately advanced as a species]]. We were able to read a piece of text, listen to a parable and not make the same mistakes as our elders.

That's why I use [[Obsidian]] -- it's probably one of the most durable forms of knowledge store.

Take heed: some of these notes are solutions, others are simply observationsÔºçbrain-teasers, a paradox to ponder. One tenet I have about reality is that it becomes so much easier when you understand that [[There are problems to be solved and problems to be enjoyed]]. So don't read notes with any expectation. Notes are either designed to get you to take action, others are designed to get you to reflect.

The beauty of this rich tapestry is that there are no categories, it doesn't force a particular way of thinking other than letting patterns emerge for themselves. Everything is networked, much like our minds' neurons. It's a web of ideas, all linked like a wiki. There are no indices or conventional navigational aids. To embark on this intellectual voyage, you'll need to follow a link that piques your interest. 

Who knows? As you read through... maybe more patterns and connected ideas will emerge for you. That's the point of this work: *Cultivating fertile soil to grow more ideas for myself and others*. Shed more light. Facing the [[Truth]].

Here's a few key links to start your journey:

- [[Library]]
- [[¬ßWhat‚Äôs top of mind]]

All the best,

üëã Will Marzella
