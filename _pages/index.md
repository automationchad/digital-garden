Hi, I'm Will. 

### You are here

Welcome to the Ronin Repository: my [[Pattern language|mind's toolbox]], always evolving, always relevant. These notes are primarily for me, serving as my thinking environment ([[Â§Conscious capitalism]];Â [[My morning writing practice]]).

Shared publicly as a test-run ([[Work with the garage door up]]). If something seems off, it's likely not penned for you. That's the experiment's crux ([[Write notes for yourself by default, disregarding audience]]).

Life's got its share of problemsâ€”[[problems to be solved and problems to be enjoyed|some to crack, some to ponder]]. Dive in with an open mind. Some notes might serve as a [[Pattern language|playbook]]; others, just food for thought.

No index here, just follow a link to start. Maybe check out [[Â§Whatâ€™s top of mind]] or the [[Library]].

I use [[Obsidian]] for managing this growing knowledge pool. A robust ally for navigating real-world knowledgeâ€™s maze.

So, explore this haven for intellectual cross-pollination. Ideas here dance, evolve, inching closer to the [[truth]].

PS: A common query pops upâ€”no, I haven't opened this system for others yet. I'm probably never going to create a course or educate others in a mass-medium way, and [[Premature scaling can stunt system iteration]].
