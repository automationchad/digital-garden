Hi, I'm Will. 

### You are here

The Ronin Repository.

Think of it as a [[Pattern language|toolbox for your mind]], always updating, always relevant. 

It's not just about hoarding knowledge; it's about making that knowledge actionable and amplifying its impact. We've come a long way as humans by [[Work with the garage door up|passing down stories]]â€”those pre-packaged experiences that save us a lot of trial and error. That's the same principle here.

Note for the Andrew Tate plebs: This is not about escaping the matrix. [[You canâ€™t escape society. You are part of a society, whether you like it or not.]]. It's how to navigate society easier, better.

Life's got its share of problemsâ€”[[problems to be solved and problems to be enjoyed|some to crack, some to ponder]]. Keep an open mind when you dive into these notes. Some might offer you a [[Pattern language|playbook]]; others, food for thought.

What sets this repository apart is its fluid structure. Forget rigid categories; this is more like your brainâ€”a sprawling, interconnected network of ideas and insights. I use [[Obsidian]] to manage this ever-growing database. It's a robust platform that keeps up with how complex and nuanced real-world knowledge tends to be.

So, explore. This is a space that thrives on intellectual cross-pollination. Ideas here aren't static; they evolve, they interact, and sometimes they morph into something closer to the [[truth]].
