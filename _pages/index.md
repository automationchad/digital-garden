Hi, I'm Will. You may know me as *marzella* [[Who is this guy?|that]] fella. Currently wandering the earth in search of adventure. 


### You are here

The Ronin Repository.

My sanctuary is an ever-evolving collection of solutions and observationsâ€”a dynamic [[pattern language]] for understanding the very nature of existence.

I strive to acquire, use and [[Work with the garage door up|share]] consumate skill and technique.

For posterity, this tapestry is my legacy. It's something I hope to leave behind for my children: [[Storytelling is how we ultimately advanced as a species]]. With every story passed down, we were spared from reliving our ancestors' follies.

That's why I use [[Obsidian]], a bastion for enduring wisdom.

Navigate these notes with an open heart: some will offer solutions, while others may merely be musings, enigmas to contemplate. 

Remember, reality offers [[problems to be solved and problems to be enjoyed]]. So, approach each note without preconceived notionsâ€”some aim to spur action, others to inspire introspection.

The wonder of this intricate web lies in its organic design. It eschews rigid categorization, inviting you instead to let patterns naturally unfold. A network of interlinked ideas, it mirrors the synaptic dance of our minds. 

This isn't your traditional navigationâ€”with no indices or familiar pathways. Begin your exploration by pursuing a link that resonates.

- [[Library]]
- [[Â§Whatâ€™s top of mind]]

As you meander through, you might find new patterns emerging, new connections taking root. That is the essence of this sanctuary: to cultivate a fertile ground, a nexus where ideas germinate and flourish, beckoning us closer to the [[Truth]].
