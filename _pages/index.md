Hi, I'm Will. You may know me as *marzella* [[Who is this guy?|that]] fella. Currently wandering the earth in search of adventure. 


### You are here

The Ronin Repository.

An ever-evolving collection of solutions and observationsâ€”a dynamic [[pattern language]] for understanding the very nature of existence.

Acquiring, using and [[Work with the garage door up|sharing]] consumate skill and technique.

The other goal is to leave this tapestry behind for my children ([[Storytelling is how we ultimately advanced as a species]]). With every story passed down, we were spared from reliving our ancestors' mistakes.

That's why I use [[Obsidian]], a durable tool for knowledge growth.

Please navigate these notes with an open heart: some will offer solutions, while others may merely be observations; concepts to contemplate. 

Remember, reality offers [[problems to be solved and problems to be enjoyed]]. So, approach each note without preconceived notionsâ€”some aim to spur action, others to inspire introspection.

The true wonder of this intricate web lies in its organic design. A network of interlinked ideas, it mirrors the synaptic dance of our minds. [[So above as below]]. It removes rigid categorization, inviting you instead to meander through, you might find new patterns emerging, new connections taking root. 

That is the essence of this sanctuary: to cultivate a fertile ground, a nexus where ideas germinate and flourish, getting us closer to the [[Truth]].

Begin your exploration by pursuing a link that resonates.
