I'm Will. You may know me as *marzella*. Currently wandering the earth in search of adventure. 

### You are here

The Ronin Repository, a haven for sharing my ever-evolving ideas.

This space is where I engage in what some call [[digital gardening]], cultivating a thriving ecosystem of interconnected notes that continually challenge my beliefs and assumptions. In doing so, I strive to enhance my thinking, foster continuous learning, and fuel my creativity.

As you explore this repository, you'll find a few key links to start your journey:

- [[Library]]
- [[Work with the garage door up]]
- [[§What’s top of mind]]

Please note that, for now, there are no indices or conventional navigational aids. To embark on this intellectual voyage, you'll need to follow a link that piques your interest and sets you on your path. So, dive in, explore, and join me in this digital realm of discovery.
