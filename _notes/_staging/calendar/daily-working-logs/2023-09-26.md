Tray wants to develop a non-technical product for developers, while also slamming Mulesoft for demanding too much technical know-how. See the irony? Mulesoft needs that level of expertise for good reason: greater functionality brings greater complexity. You can't have it both ways. We either design for business users and keep it simple, or we cater to enterprise developers and build a better Mulesoft. But the features we roll out need to align with our objective.
