The perception of others as demons is often a reflection of our own inner turmoil. We project onto others what we refuse to acknowledge in ourselves. When we label others as demons, we're often blind to our own darker aspects, our own inner "demons."

Are others truly malevolent, or is this a projection of your own unrecognized dark side? The answer lies in self-awareness. Once you recognize that everyone, including yourself, harbors darker impulses or "demons," the labels start to lose their power.

The revelation here is that these so-called demons are part of the human experience; they're elements of our shared psyche. When you understand that, the distinction between you and others begins to blur. The demons cease to be demons; they become facets of a complex human identity that we all share.

By acknowledging our darker aspects, we don't feed them further but understand them, integrate them, and rob them of their disruptive power. In doing so, we not only come to peace with ourselves but also bridge the gap between us and others. The walls come down, the judgments fade, and what's left is a more unified understanding of human nature. And in that unity, the concept of 'demon' becomes obsolete. We're all just people, flawed but capable of growth, division, and, ultimately, unity.

Q: Are they demons because they don’t realise there demons and I’m observing their devilry or am I projecting my own unknowingness of my own devilry? 

A: Once you realize that everyone are demons including yourself, everyone ceases to be demons. We end the comparison. We become one with one another.
