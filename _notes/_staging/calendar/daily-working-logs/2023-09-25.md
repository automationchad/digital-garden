The Motis Group vision is to meet the needs of us (aka money), ability to have will travel, easy business with actually good clients , no shit customers/leads.

1. **Maximizing Revenue**: Aim for high-margin projects and diversify revenue streams. Consider productized services as a secondary income. Go after big fish clients who understand the value of your expertise and are willing to pay for it.

2. **Mobility**: Choose technology stacks and workflows that enable your team to work from anywhere. Stick to cloud-based tools and make sure everyone on your team is trained to operate in a remote setting. This mobility not only attracts top talent but also allows you to meet clients face-to-face when needed, without disrupting operations.

3. **Streamlined Business Operations**: Implement CRM and project management tools that integrate seamlessly with your workflow. Automate repetitive tasks. You don’t need excess manual operations draining your resources. You're in the business of solving problems, not managing spreadsheets.

4. **Quality Clientele**: Develop a robust vetting process for your clients. Set the bar high. Good clients don’t just come with deep pockets; they communicate well and respect your expertise. Shun the time-wasters and those who try to haggle your worth to the last penny.

5. **No Incompetent Leads**: Qualify leads ruthlessly. Use your first interactions to gauge not just their budget but their company culture, workflow, and communication style. Use this information to predict how they would behave in a working relationship.

For each of these pillars, apply the following:

- **Maximizing Revenue**: Directly ask previous clients for upsell opportunities or referrals.

- **Mobility**: Allocate budget for essential travel; don't just wait for the need to arise.

- **Streamlined Business Operations**: Perform quarterly audits to identify bottlenecks and areas for automation.

- **Quality Clientele**: Always close contracts with a detailed Statement of Work (SoW). Make no exceptions.

- **No Incompetent Leads**: Utilize social proof and case studies on your consultancy's website to deter subpar leads from even reaching out.

The thing that plagues companies is having a vision but not the ability to execute. There's a disconnet between the goal and the infrastructure. But there's a chicken and egg scenario that pops up here: You need money for infrastructure but you also need infrastructure to pursue opportunities to get more money. What's the play here then?

I'm currently on an F-1 visa with STEM OPT that expires on February 15, 2023. I have plans to visit Australia from December 10, 2023, to February 12, 2024. My goal is to transition to an E-3 visa with my current employer before I leave for Australia. This would allow me to obtain the necessary stamp from the consulate in Melbourne, ensuring a seamless return to the U.S. What's the most effective strategy to secure the E-3 visa before my departure, given the potential risks, such as my current company folding or delays in the process?

> Note: I omitted the Italian citizenship because the focus of the rewritten question was on securing the E-3 visa with your current employer before leaving the U.S. The Italian citizenship is a longer-term option that, by my own assessment, won't be sorted out in time to influence the immediate E-3 visa situation.

My Dad answered pretty well, "with money everything else is just paperwork". Focus on securing the bag FIRST, then you can handle everything else. 


### Immediate Actions:

1. **Push for E-3 with the Current Company**: While keeping your eyes open for other opportunities, exert pressure on your current employer to expedite the E-3 process. You've built a relationship with them; leverage that. Ensure all the necessary paperwork is in order well before your travel date.
    
2. **Apply for Remote Jobs**: Simultaneously, cast a wider net by applying for remote jobs in Europe. Since you're getting Italian citizenship, this option could serve as a viable fallback. *Remote roles offer flexibility, and you can start these while still in the U.S. or Australia.*
    
3. **Plan B with a New U.S Company**: Apply for other U.S-based jobs that would be willing to sponsor an E-3. Have a shortlist and get the ball rolling on applications. The clock is ticking on your OPT, so act now.
    

### Contingencies:

- **Company Instability**: If your current company is at risk of going under, have contingencies in place. This means not just a list of jobs or companies, but also pre-prepared application materials tailored for a rapid pivot.
    
- **F-1 OPT Expiry**: Given your tight timeline around the visa expiry and your travel plans, *you need the E-3 sorted before you leave the U.S*. Since you're on an F-1 visa OPT that expires in February, the timing of your travel could potentially make it risky to re-enter the U.S. without a new visa in place. The process of securing an E-3 could take time, and there's always the possibility of delays. The point is, *whether it's with your current company or a new one, you want that E-3 nailed down before you set foot on a plane.*
    
- **Italian Citizenship**: It's a strong card but not immediate. Citizenship processes can be notoriously slow and bureaucratic. While it could open doors for you in Europe, it's not a factor you can bank on in the immediate timeframe of your current dilemma so *treat it as a future advantage rather than a present solution.*


What jobs?

1. **Current Job**: Prioritize getting the E-3 with your current employer. The established relationship and role-specific experience could streamline the process.
    
2. **Remote Jobs**: Focus on roles that align with your skill set and that allow for remote work. This can act as a safety net and gives you a secondary path, particularly advantageous if you secure Italian citizenship.
    
3. **New U.S. Companies**: If there are firms in the U.S. that you're interested in and align with your career trajectory, apply to those as well, but be discerning. Make sure they are companies you'd actually want to work for and that would realistically sponsor an E-3.

Types of roles:

1. Sales Engineer
2. Pre-Sales Engineer
3. Technical Sales Consultant
4. Solutions Consultant
5. Solutions Architect
6. Technical Solutions Engineer
7. Integrations Consultant
8. Implementation Consultant

### Financial Considerations:

Your only significant financial tie in the U.S. is a car payment. Weigh the cost against the benefit. Can you offload the car, or is it indispensable for your U.S. lifestyle? Don't discount this expense when considering your options.

### Summary:

Push your current company hard for the E-3 now. 
If they can't secure it in time, you'll need an alternative path lined up, whether that's another U.S. job or a remote role in Europe. 

Given your Italian citizenship play, remote European roles could be your ultimate direction, but you need a bridge to get there—your current job and an expedited E-3 may be that bridge. 

Keep all these balls in the air, because relying on just one is too risky given the variables at play.
