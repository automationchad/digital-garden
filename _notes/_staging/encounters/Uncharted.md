What does it mean to go to lands uncharted?

People have already explored and traversed most lands.

Uncharted means seeing them with a new perspective.

Think about the video game Uncharted.

What exactly about it - that sort of life - allures you?

Music album called “Postcards” - snapshots in time.

Like the attic in Uncharted full of treasures - symbols of experience.

- You also see when things go wrong, when you lie to the people who are close to you. It erodes trust.
