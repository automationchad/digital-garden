Three people in the world who make a lot of money

1. Capital allocators, encompassing venture capitalists (VCs), private equity (PE) managers, and hedge fund moguls, manipulate vast pools of capital to generate outsized returns. Their remuneration often comes in the form of "2 and 20" feesâ€”2% of assets under management and 20% of profits. Their skill lies not just in quantitative acumen but also in gauging market psychology, regulatory landscapes, and macroeconomic indicators. They're high-stakes gamblers with other people's money, but the best among them create value by identifying and nurturing businesses that might have otherwise languished for lack of funds.
2. Entrepreneurs, on the other hand, are the creative engines of the economic machine. Their wealth often materializes as equity in businesses they've founded or co-founded. They bear the burden of risk and uncertainty but stand to gain immensely if their ventures succeed. Unlike capital allocators, their expertise lies in product-market fit, operational efficiency, and innovation.
3. Virtuosos are masters in their respective fields, be it sports, art, or technology. Consider [[LeBron James]], whose basketball prowess, coupled with shrewd business ventures, has made him one of the wealthiest athletes or [[Marco Pierre White]], a British chef and restaurateur. Having become the youngest chef to win three Michelin stars, he leveraged his culinary mastery into a business empire, featuring restaurants, cookbooks, and media appearances. Virtuosos monetize their unparalleled skillsets through sponsorships, endorsements, and often, by venturing into entrepreneurship or capital allocation themselves.
