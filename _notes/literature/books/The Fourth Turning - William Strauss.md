### Four Turnings in a Societal Cycle

#### High Phase

The High phase marks a time of strong institutions and suppressed individualism. During this phase, society is optimistic about its collective direction. However, nonconformists often find this environment stifling. The post-WWII American High from 1946 to JFK's assassination in 1963 exemplifies this phase.

#### Awakening Phase

The Awakening phase is marked by an attack on institutions in favor of personal and spiritual freedom. Public progress peaks, but societal focus shifts towards individualism and spirituality. The U.S. saw this phase during the "Consciousness Revolution" of the mid-1960s to the early 1980s.

#### Unraveling Phase

The Unraveling phase is characterized by weak institutions and strong individualism. It tends to follow an Awakening and is exemplified by societal fragmentation. The 1980s marked the start of America's latest Unraveling, including events like the Long Boom and Culture War.

#### Crisis Phase

The Crisis phase is an era marked by upheaval, often involving war or revolution. Here, society's institutions are broken down and rebuilt, restoring civic authority and community focus. The previous U.S. Crisis began with the 1929 Wall Street Crash and ended with WWII.

### Generational Archetypes

- **Dominant Generations**:
    - **Prophet**: Experiences an Awakening during young adulthood, characterized by an attack on institutions for personal autonomy.
    - **Hero**: Experiences a Crisis during young adulthood, characterized by the destruction and rebuilding of institutions.
- **Recessive Generations**:
    - **Nomad**: Experiences an Unraveling during young adulthood, characterized by weakened institutions and flourishing individualism.
    - **Artist**: Experiences a High during young adulthood, characterized by strong institutions and suppressed individualism.

### Generational Lifecycle & Sociodemographic Cycles

An average human lifespan is roughly 80 years, segmented into Childhood, Young Adult, Midlife, and Elderhood. Correspondingly, society experiences a new generation approximately every 20 years (Baby Boomers, Gen X, Millennials, Homelanders).

The interaction between generations defines the societal cycle through four turnings (High, Awakening, Unraveling, Crisis). A generation's influence is determined as either "dominant" or "recessive" depending on the societal phase they encounter as young adults.
