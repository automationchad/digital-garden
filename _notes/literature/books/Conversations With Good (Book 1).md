_Feeling is the language of the soul._ 

  

If you want to now what’s true for you about something, look to how you’re _feeling_ about it. Hidden in your deepest feelings is your highest truth.

  

Words are merely utterances: _noises_ that _stand for_ feelings, thoughts, and experience. They are symbols. Signs. Insignias. They are not Truth. 

  

Your experience and your feelings about a thing represent what you factually and intuitively know about that thing. Words can only seek to _symbolise_ what you know, and can often _confuse_ what you know. 

  

The Highest Thought is always that thought which contains joy. The Clearest Words are those words which truth. The Grandest Feeling is that feeling which you call love. Joy, truth, love. These three are interchangeable, and one always leads to the other. It matters not in which order they are placed. 

  

The most powerful messenger is experience. 

  

I have no form or shape you _understand._ I could _adopt_ a form or shape that you _could_  understand, but then everyone would assume that what they have seen is the one and only form and shape of God, rather than a form or shape of God–one of many. 

  

You will not have that which you ask, nor can you have anything you want. This is because your very request is a statement of lack, and your saying you want a thing only works to produce that precise experience – wanting – in your reality. 

  

If you believe that God is some omnipotent being who hears all prayers, says “yes” to some, “no” to others, and “maybe, but not now” to the rest, you are mistaken. By what rule of thumb would God decide? If you believe that God is the _creator and decider of all thing_ in your life, you are mistaken. God is the _observer,_ not the creator_._ 

  

_It is not God’s function to create or uncreate, the circumstances or conditions of you life._ God gave you free choice, to do with life as you will. _Your will for you, is God’s will for you._ 

  

The grand illusion in which we have engaged is that God _cares_ one way or the other what you do. It this dichotomy – not caring deeply about the process, but caring deeply about the result– that comes close to describing of God. Yet God, in a sense, does not even care about the outcome. Not the _ultimate outcome_. This is because the ultimate outcome is assured. And this is the second great illusion of man: that the outcome of life is in doubt. It is this doubt about ultimate outcome that has created your greatest enemy, which is fear.

  

All human actions are motivated at their deepest level by one of two emotions – fear or love. These are the two points which allow the system you call “relativity” to be. _And so it is that in the moment you pledge your highest love, you greet your greatest fear._ For the first thing you worry about after saying “I love you” is whether you’ll hear it back. Fear is the energy which contracts, closes down, draws in, runs, hides, hoards, harms. Love is the energy which expands, opens up, sends out, stays, reveals, shares, heals. Fear wraps our bodies in  clothing, love allows us to stand naked. Fear clings to and clutches all that we have, love gives all that we have away. Fear holds close, love holds dear, Fear traps, love lets go. Fear rankles, love soothes. Fear attacks, love amends. _Every human thought, word, or deed is used in one emotion or the other. You have no choice about this, because there is nothing else from which to choose. But you have free choice about which of these to select._ 

  

There is only one purpose for all of life, and that is for you and all that lives to experience fullest glory. Should there come a moment in which you experience yourself in your fullest glory, you will in that instant imagine an every great glory to fulfil. The more you are, the more you can become, and the you can become, the more you can yet be.

  

_The deepest secret is that life is not a process of discovery, but a process of creation._ You are not discovering yourself, but creating yourself anew. Seek, therefore, not to find out Who You Are, seek to determine Who You Want to Be.

  

LIFE WILL NEVER COME TO YOU. You must come to life.

**Why are we here?** 

  

To remember, and re-create, Who You Are.

  

School is a place you go if there is something you do not know that you want to know. It is not a place you go if you already know a thing and simply want to _experience your knowingness._ Life is an opportunity for you to _know experientially_ what you already know _conceptually._ You need _learn nothing_ to do this. You need merely remember what you already know, and _act on it._ 

  

You soul knows all there is to know all the time. There’s nothing hidden, nothing unknown. Yet knowing is not enough. The soul seeks to experience. You can know yourself to be generous, but unless you _do_ something which displays generosity, you have nothing but a concept. It is your soul’s only desire to turn its grandest _concept_ about itself into its greatest _experience._ Until concept becomes experience all there is, is speculation. 

  

The one thing at “All That Is” knew is that there was _nothing else._ And so “It” could, and would, _never_ know Itself from a reference point outside of itself. This _energy_ chose to experience itself as the utter magnificence It was. In order to do this, It realised IT would have to use a reference point _within._  It reasoned that any _portion_ of Itself would necessarily have to be _less than the whole,_ and that if It thus simply _divided_ Itself into portions, could look back on the rest of Itself and see magnificent. For the first time, _this_ and _that_  existed. And still, both existed simultaneously. As did all that was _neither._ Thus, _three elements_ suddenly existed: that which is _here_. That which is _there_. And that which is _neither here not there_ - but which _must exist_ for _here and there_ to exist. It is the nothing which holds the everything. 

  

In rendering the universe as a _divided version of Itself,_ God produced, from pure energy, all that now exists – both seen and unseen.

  

My divine purpose in dividing Me was to create sufficient parts of Me so that I could _know Myself experientially._ Thus it can be said that My purpose for you is that _you_ should know yourself as _Me._ 

  

There is one way I could have caused all of My spiritual children to know themselves as parts of Me – and that was simply to tell them. However, knowing something and _experiencing_ it are two different things. Under the plan, you as pure spirit would enter the physical universe just created. This is because _physicality_ is the only way to know experientially what you know conceptually. Once in the physical universe, you, My spirit children, could experience what you know of yourself – but first, you had to _come to know the opposite._ Taken to the ultimate logic, you cannot experience yourself as what you are until you’ve encountered what you are _not._ This is the purpose of the theory of relativity, and all physical life. It is by that which you are _not_ that you yourself are defined. 

  

Upon entering the physical universe, you _relinquished your remembrance of yourself._ The allows you to _choose_ to be Who You Are, rather than just have it handed to you. It is in the act of choosing to be, rather than simply being told that your are, a part of God that you _experience_ yourself as being at total choice, which is what, by definition, God is. 

  

You are, have always been, and will always be, a _divine part_ of the _divine whole,_ a _member of the body._ Your job on Earth, therefore, is not to _learn_ (because you _already know_), but to re-member Who You Are. And to re-member who everyone else is. 

  

**Why is the world in the shape it’s in?**

  

I do not show My goodness by creating only what you call perfection all around you. You cannot demonstrate love until you can demonstrate _not_ loving. Knowing is a divine state, yet the grandest joy is in Being. _Being_ is achieved only after experience. 

  

Do to condemn, therefore, all that you would call bad in the world. Rather, ask yourself, what about this have you judged bad, and what, if anything, you wish to do to change it. Inquire within, rather than without, asking: “what [art of my Self do I wish to experience now in the face of this calamity? What aspect of being do I choose to call forth?” 

  

For all life exists as a tool of your own creation, and all pdf its events merely present themselves as opportunities for you to decide, and be, Who You Are. There are no victims in the universe, only creators. 

  

Therefore, be a light unto the darkness, and curse it not. And forgot not Who You Are in the moment of your encirclement by that which you are not. 

  

You came into this life with nothing to learn – you have only demonstrate what you already know. In the demonstration of it will you function it out, and create yourself anew, through your experience. Thus do you justify life, and give it purpose. Thus do you render it holy

  

You create collectively, and individually, the life and times you are experiencing, for the soul purpose of evolving. The way to reduce the pain which you associate with early experiences and events – both yours and those of others – _is to change the way you behold them._

  

**What is hell?**

  

It is the experience of the worst possible outcome of your choices, decisions, and creations. It is knowing Who and What You Are, and failing to experience that. It is being _less._ 

  

_You_ are your own rule-maker. You set the guidelines. And _you_ decide how well you have done; how well you are doing. For _you_ are the one who has decided Who and What You Really Are – and Who You Want To Be

  

The true renunciate does not renounce, but simply _chooses differently_. This is an act of moving **towards something**, not away from something.

  

Passion is the love of turning being into action. It fuels the engine of creation. It changes concepts to experience. 

  

Passion is the fire that drives us to express who we really are. Never deny passion, for that is to deny Who You Are and Who You Truly Want To Be. 

  

The renunciate never denies passion – the renunciate simply denies attachment to results. Passion is a love of doing. Doing is being, _experienced._ Yet what is often created as part of doing? _Expectation._ To live your life without _expectation_ – without the need for specific results – _that_ is freedom. That is Godliness.

  

**What’s the point? If there is no way _not_ to “get there,” what is the point of life? Why should we worry about at all about anything we do?**

  

Well, of course, you _shouldn’t._ But you _would do well_ to her observant. Simply notice who and what you are being, doing, and having, and see whether it serves you. _The point of life is not to get anywhere – it is to notice that you are, and have always been, already there. You are, always and forever, in the moment of pure creation. The point of life is therefore to_ create _– who and what you are, and then to_ experience _that._
