### Chapter I
*How Usury Destroyed the Roman Empire*

> “Money, being naturally barren, to make it breed money is preposterous and a perversion from the end of its institution, which was only to serve the purpose of exchange and not of increase... Men called bankers we shall hate, for they enrich themselves while doing nothing."" – Aristotle, Politics

There is nothing wrong with fiat money as long as it's issued by government, not by private bankers and is carefully protected against counterfeiters. 

Non-fiat money has the serious drawback that whoever sets the price of gold and silver i.e private bankers, can control the nations economy.

Caesar fully understood the evils of usury and how to counter them. "He recognised the profound truth that money is a national agent, created by law for national purpose, and that no classes of men should withhold it from circulation so as to cause panics, in order that speculators could advance the rates of interest, or could buy up property at ruinous prices after such panic."

Caesar's monetray reforms:

1. State debt levels were immediately reduced by 25%.
2. Control of the mint was transferred from the patricians (usurers) to government.
3. Cheap metal coins were issued as the means of exchange.
4. It was ruled that interest could not be levied at more than 1% per month.
5. It was decreed that interest could not be charged on interest and that the total interest charged could never exceed the capital loaned (*in duplum* rule)
6. Slavery was abolished as a means of settling debt
7. Aristrocrats were forced to employ their capital and not hoard it.

These reforms enraged the aristocrats and plutocrats whose "livelihood" was severely restricted. They conspired Caesar's murder and he was then subsequently stabbed to death in the Senate building.

Major factors in the decline of the Roman Empire were: 

1. The concentration of wealth
2. The absence or mining deposits for industrial production
3. The vast importation of non-White slaves with the resultant degradation of the genetic value of the nation. See: [[Immigration to dilute local populace]]

The most important economic reason was an inadequate supply of an inexpensive circulating medium of money and the false notion that money should be a commodity.

The main lesson from the fall of Rome: **A dishonest economic system will inevitably contribute to the forces of dissolution.**

For any society to function and prosper it is absolutely fundamental that the means of exchange be issued free of debt and interest by the legal authority of the state as representatives of the people in perpetuity.
