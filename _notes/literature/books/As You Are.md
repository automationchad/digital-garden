**Section One: How to Start Interactions Fearlessly**

  

**Chapter 1: The Only Thing That Matters When You Start A Conversation**

  

The secret to starting conversations is that no one can blow you off unless you let them. 

  

If you come in apologetically – unsure of yourself and looking for validation from people to let you know that you're okay – then you are likely to get dismissed.

  

If you come in with a strong presence, sure of your actions, and present yourself in a way that deserves attention, then it will be nearly impossible for people to brush you away.

  

Within the first 5 to 10 seconds of meeting you, people have already formed their judgements about you. Other than their own mood at the time and your instant mutual chemistry, the only thing that this judgement is based off of is your ability to hold space.

  

Holding space is simply allowing your feelings, when communicating with someone to arise and listening to them rather than running away from them by cycling through personal social avoidance mechanisms.

  

The goals of starting conversations with strangers shouldn't be to get a positive response, it should simply be to find out who's interested in talking more - and who isn't.

  

Whether it's a first date, a business meeting, holding a conversation, or getting more sexual, allowing your - and everyone else's - genuine feelings to be expressed instead of avoiding and twisting them through your fears is the most valuable skill you will ever learn.
