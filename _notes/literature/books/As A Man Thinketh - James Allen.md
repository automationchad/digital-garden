“Effect of Thought on Circumstances.”

  

“Man’s mind may be likened to a garden, which may be intelligently cultivated or allowed to run wild; but whether cultivated or neglected, it must, and will, bring forth.”

  

“Just as a gardener cultivates his plot, keeping it free from weeds, and growing the flowers and fruits which he requires, so may a man tend the garden of his mind, weeding out all the wrong, useless, and impure thoughts...”

  

“... and cultivating toward perfection the flowers and fruits of right, useful, and pure thoughts. By pursuing this process, a man sooner or later discovers that HE is the master-gardener of his soul, the director of his LIFE.”

  

“He also reveals, within himself, the laws of thought, and understands, with ever-increasing accuracy, how the thought-forces and mind elements operate in the shaping of his character, circumstances, and DESTINY.”

  

“Every thought-seed sown or allowed to fall into the mind, and to take root there, produces its own, blossoming sooner or later into act, and bearing its own fruitage of opportunity and circumstance. Good thoughts bear good fruit, bad thoughts bad fruit.”

  

“As the reaper of his own harvest, man learns both by suffering and bliss…”

  

“Men do not attract that which they want, but that which they are…”

  

“Not what he wishes and prays for does a man get, but what he justly earns.”

  

“Men are anxious to improve their circumstances, but are unwilling to improve themselves; they therefore remain bound.”

  

“Good thoughts and actions can never produce bad results; bad thoughts and actions can never produce good results. This is but saying that nothing can come from corn but corn, nothing from nettles but nettles...”

  

“...Men understand this law in the natural world, and work with it; but few understand it in the mental and moral world, and they, therefore, do not co-operate with it."

  

“A man only begins to be a man when he ceases to whine and revile, and commences to search for the hidden justice which regulates his life...”

  

“...And as he adapts his mind to the regulating factor, he ceases to accuse others as the cause of his condition, and build himself up in strong and noble thoughts...”

  

“... ceases to kick against circumstances, but begins to use them as aids to his more rapid progress, and as a means of discovering the hidden powers and possibilities within himself.”

  

“As a man thinketh in his heart so is he.”
