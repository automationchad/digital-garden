Two main categories of groups: 

1. The first is made up of the cults and cult-like groups to expose their recruits and members to organised psychological and social persuasion processes. Designed to produce attitudinal changes and to establish remarkable degrees of control by the group over these recruits' and members' lives. These cults deceive, manipulate, and exploit their members and hope to keep them for as long as possible.
2. The second category consists of the commercially sold large group awareness training programs and other "self-improvement", psychologyâ€“based, or miscellaneous organisations that use similar intense coordinated persuasion processes but ordinarily do not intend to keep their customers for long periods of membership. They prefer that adherents buy more courses and products and bring more customers, staying around for perhaps a year or two.

**Cultic relationship**: relationship in which a person intentionally induces others to become totally or nearly totally dependent on him or her for almost all major life decisions, and inculcates in these followers a belief that he or she has some special talent, gift, or knowledge.

For our purposes, the label *cult* refers to the three factors: 

1. the origin of the group and the role of the leader.
	1. Cult leaders are self appointed, persuasive persons who claim to have a special mission in life, or to have special knowledge
	2. Cult leaders tend to be determined and domineering and are often described as charismatic
	3. Cult leaders centre veneration on themselves.
2. the power structure, or relationship between the leader (or leaders), and the followers
	1. Colts are authoritarian in structure
	2. Cults appear to be innovative and exclusive.
	3. Cults tend to have a double set of ethics.
3. the use of a coordinated program of persuasion (which is called reform, or, more commonly, brainwashing)
	1. Cults tends to be totalistic, or all encompassing, in controlling their members' behaviour, and also ideologically, totalistic, exhibiting zealotry and extremism in their worldview
	2. Cults tend to require members to undergo a major disruption or change in lifestyle.
