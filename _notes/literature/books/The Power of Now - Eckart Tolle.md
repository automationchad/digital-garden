### **Chapter 1: You Are Not Your Mind**

  

**The Greatest Obstacle to Enlightenment**

The word enlightenment conjures up the idea of some super-human accomplishment, and the ego likes to keep it that way, but it is simply your natural state of felt oneness with Being. It is a state of connectedness with something immeasurable and indestructible, something that, almost paradoxically, is essentially you and yet is much greater than you.

Being is the eternal, ever present One Life beyond the myriad forms of life that are subject to birth and death. When you are present, when your attention is fully and intensely in the Now, Being can be felt, but it can never be understood mentally. To regain awareness of Being and to abide in that state of "feeling-realization" is enlightenment.

  

The greatest obstacle to experiencing this reality is identification with your mind, which causes thought to be compulsive. Identification with your mind creates an opaque screen of concepts, labels, images, words, judgements, and definitions that blocks all true relationship. It is not so much that you use your mind wrongly – you usually don't use it at all. It uses you. This is the disease. You believe you are your mind. This is the delusion. The instrument has taken you over. 

  

The beginning of freedom is the realisation that you are not the possessing entity – the thinker. Knowing this enables you to observe the entity. The moment you start watching the thinker, a higher level of consciousness becomes activated. You then begin to realize that there is a vast realm of intelligence beyond thought, that thought is only a tiny aspect of that intelligence. 

  

You also realize that all the things that truly matter – beauty, love, creativity, joy, inner peace – arise from beyond the mind. You begin to awaken.

  

**Freeing Yourself From Your Mind**

  

When you listen to a thought, you are aware not only of the thought but also of yourself as the witness of the thought. As you listen to the thought, you feel a conscious presence – your deeper self – behind or underneath the thought. 

  

Learn to disidentify from your mind. Smile at the voice in your head, as you would the antics of a child. 

  

**Enlightenment: Rising Above Thought**

  

Your mind is an instrument, a tool. It is there to be used for a specific task, and when the task is completed, you lay it down. We are addicted to thinking because you are identified with it, which means that you derive your sense of self from the content and activity of your mind. Because you believe that you would cease to be if you stopped thinking. 

  

As you grow up, you form a mental image of who you are based on your personal and cultural conditioning. We may call this phantom self the ego. The _ego_ means a false self, created by unconscious identification with the mind.

  

The ego is always concerned with keeping the past alive, because without it – who are you? 

  

Even when the ego seems to be concerned with the present, it is not the present that it sees: it misperceives it because it looks at it through the eyes of the past. Or it reduces the present to a means to an end, an end that always lies in the mind-projected future.

  

The present moment holds the key to liberation. But you cannot find the present moment as long as you are your mind.

  

In the enlightened state, you still use your thinking mind when needed, but in a much more focused and effective way than before. You use it mostly for practical purposes, but you are free of the involuntary internal dialogue, and there is inner stillness. 

  

**Emotion: The Body's Reaction To Your Mind**

  

Mind is not just thought. It includes your emotions as well as all unconscious mental-emotional reactive patterns. Emotion arises at the place where mind and body meet. It's a reflection of your mind in the body. 

  

Joy, love and peace are not emotions. They lie beyond the emotions, on a much deeper level. As such, they have no opposite because they arise from beyond the mind. 

### **Chapter 2: Consciousness - The Way Out Of Pain**

  

**Create No More Pain In The Present**

  

The greater part of human pain is unnecessary. It is self-created as long as the unobserved mind runs your life. The pain that you create now is always some form of nonacceptance, some form of unconscious resistance to what _is._ 

  

If you no longer want to create pain for yourself and others, then don’t create any more time, or at least no more than is necessary to deal with the practical aspects of your life. How to stop creating time?

  

_Realize deeply that the present moment is all you ever have._

  

**Past Pain: Dissolving The Pain-Body (The Devil)**

  

As long as you are unable to access the power of the Now every emotional pain that you experience leaves behind a residue of pain that lives on in you. It merges with the pain from the past, which was already there, and becomes lodged in your mind and body.

  

The pain-body wants to survive, just like every other entity in existence, and it can only survive if it gets you to unconsciously identify with it. It can then rise up, take you over, “become you” and live through you. It need to get its “food” through you. It will feed on any experience that resonates with its own kind of energy, anything that creates further pain in whatever form: anger, destructiveness, hatred, grief, emotional drama, violence, and even illness. Pain can only feed on pain. Pain cannot feed on joy.

  

The pain-body, which is the dark shadow cast by the ego, is actually afraid of the light of your consciousness. It it afraid of being found out. Its survival depends on your unconscious identification with it, as well as your unconscious fear of facing the pain that lives in you. The pain-body may seem to you like a dangerous monster that you cannot bear to look at, but it is an insubstantial phantom that cannot prevail against the power of your presence. 

  

**Ego Identification With The Pain-Body**

  

As long as you make an identity for yourself out of the pain, you cannot become free to it. As long as part of your sense of self is invested in your emotional pain, you will unconsciously resist or sabotage eVery attempt that you make to heal that pain. Why? Quite simply because you want to keep yourself intact, and the pain has become an essential part of you. It is the living past in you and if you identify with it, you identify with the past. A victim identify is the belief that the past is more powerful than the present, which is the opposite of the truth. It is belief that the people and what they did to you are responsible for who you are now, for your emotional pain or your inability to be your true self. The truth is that the only power there is, is contained within this moment: It is the power of your presence. Once you know that, you also realise that _you_ are responsible for your inner space now – nobody else is – and that the past cannot prevail against the power of the Now.

  

**The Origin Of Fear**

  

The psychological condition of fear is divorced from any concrete and true immediate danger. It comes in many forms: unease, worry, anxiety, nervousness, tension, dread, phobia, and so on. This kind of psychological fear is always of something that _might_ happen, not of something that is happening now. _You_ are in the here and now, while your mind is in the future.

  

As long as you are identified with your mind, the ego runs your life. Once you have disindentified from your mind, your sense of self is then derived from a deeper and truer place within yourself, not from the mind. 

  

**The Ego's Search For Wholeness**

  

Another aspect of the emotional pain that is intrinsic part of the egoic mind is a deep-seated sense of lack or incompleteness, of not being whole.  People will often enter into a compulsive pursuit of ego-gratification and things to identify with in order to fill this hole they feel within. So they strive after possessions, money, success, power, recognition, or a special relationship, basically so that they can feel better about themselves, feel more complete. 

  

As long as the egoic mind is running your life, you cannot truly be at ease; you cannot be at peace or fulfilled except for brief intervals when you obtained what you wanted, when a craving has just been fluffed. Since the ego is a derived sense of self, it needs to identify with external things. It needs to be both defended and fed constantly. The most common ego identifications have to do with possessions, the work you do, social status and recognition, knowledge and education, physical appliance, special abilities, relationships, personal and family history, belief systems and often also political, nationalistic, racial, religious, and other collective identifications. None of these is you.

### **Chapter 3: Moving Deeply Into The Now**

  

**Don’t Seek Your Self In The Mind**

  

The problems of the mind cannot be solved on the level of the mind. The Ego’s needs are endless. It feels vulnerable and threatened and so lives in a state of fear and want. Once you know how the basic dysfunction operates, there is no need to explore all its countless manifestations, no need to make it into a complex personal problem. The ego, of course, loves that. It is always seeking for something to attach itself to in order to uphold and strengthen its illusory sense of self, and it will readily attach itself to your problems. 

  

The mind in itself is not dysfunctional. It is a wonderful tool. Dysfunction sets in when you seek your self in it and mistake it for who you are. It then becomes the _ego_ mind and takes over your whole life. 

  

**End The Delusion Of Time**

  

To be identified with your mind is too be trapped in time: the compulsion to live almost exclusively through memory and anticipation. This creates an endless preoccupation with past and pure and an unwillingness to honour and acknowledge the present moment and _allow it to be._ The compulsion arises because the past gives you an identity and the future holds the promise of salvation, of fulfilment in whatever form. Both are illusions.

  

Nothing Exists Outside The Now. Nothing ever happened in the past; it happened in the Now. Nothing will ever happen in the future; it will happen in the Now.

  

**The Key To The Spiritual Dimension**

  

In the Now, in the absence of time, all your problems dissolve. Suffering needs time; it cannot survive in the Now.

  

**Accessing The Power Of The Now**

  

The mind cannot know the tree. It can only know facts or information _about_ the tree. My mind cannot know _you,_ only labels, judgments, facts, and opinions _about_ you. Being alone knows directly. 

  

if you find it hard to enter the Now directly, start by observing the habitual tendency of your mind to want to escape from the Now. You will observe that the future is usually imagined as either better or worse than the present. 

  

**Letting Go of Psychological Time**

  

Learn to use time in the practical aspects of your life but immediately return to present moment awareness when those practical matters have been dealt with. In this way there will be no build up of “psychological time”, which is identification with the past and continuous compulsive projection into the future. Clock time is not just making an appointment or planning a trip. It includes learning from the past so that we don’t repeat the same mistakes over and over. Setting goals and working toward them. Predicitj the future by means of patterns and laws, physical, mathematical and so on. But even here, within the sphere of practical living, where we cannot do without reference to past and future, the present moment remains the essential factor: Any lesson from the past becomes relevant and is applied _now._ Any planning as well as working toward achieving a particular goal is done _now._ 

  

If you set yourself a goal and work toward it, you are using clock time. You are aware of where you want to go, but you honour and give your fullest attention to the step that you are taking at this moment. If you then become excessively focused on the goal, the Now becomes reduced to a mere stepping stone to the future, with no intrinsic value. Your life’s journey is no longer an adventure, just an obsessive need to arrive, to attain, to “make it.” 

  

**The Insanity of Psychological Time**

  

You will not have any doubt that psychological time is a mental disease if you look at its collective manifestations. They occur, for example, in the form of ideologies such as communism, national socialism, or rigid religious belief systems, which operate under the implicit assumption that the highest good lies in the future and that therefore the end justifies the mean. The end is an idea, a point in the mind-projected future, when salvation in whatever form – happiness, fulfilment, equality, liberation, and so on – will be attained. Not infrequently, the means of getting there are the enslavement, torture, and murder of people in the present. 

  

Usually, the future is a replica of the past. The quality of your consciousness at this moment is what shapes the future – which of course, can only be experienced as the Now.

  

All negativity is caused by an accumulation of psychological time and denial of the present. Unease, anxiety, tension, stress, worry – all forms of fear – are caused by too much future, and not enough presence. Guilt, regret, resentment, grievances, sadness, bitterness, and all forms of non forgiveness are caused by too much past, and not enough presence. 

  

**All Problems Are Illusions Of The Mind**

  

There _are_ no problems. Only situations – to be dealt with now, or to be left alone and accepted as part of the “isness” of the present moment until they change or _can_ be dealt with. Problems are mind-made and need time to survive. They cannot survive in the actuality of the Now.

  

A great deal of what people say, think, or do is actually motivated by fear, which of course is always linked with having your four on the future and being out of touch with the Now. As there are no problems in the Now, there is no fear either.

  

Should a situation arise that you need to deal with now, your action will be clear and incisive if ti arises out of present-moment awareness. It is also more likely to be effective. It will not be a reaction coming from the past conditioning of your mind but an intuitive response to the situation. In other, instances, when the time bound mind would have reacted you will find it more effect to do nothing – just stay centred in the Now.

  

**The Joy Of Being**

  

As soon as you honour the present moment, all unhappiness and struggle dissolve, and life begins to flow with joy and ease. When you act out of present-moment awareness, whatever you do becomes imbued with a sense of quality, care, and love – even the most simple action.

  

So do not be concerned with the fruit of your action – just give attention to the action itself. The fruit will come of it’s own accord. 

  

The moment your attention turns to the Now, you feel a presence, a stillness, a peace. You no longer depend on the future for fulfilment and satisfaction – you don’t look to it for salvation. Therefore, you are not attached to the results. Neither failure nor success has the power to change your inner state of Being. You have found the life underneath your life situation. 

  

In the absence of psychological time, your sense of self is derived from Being, not from your personal past. Therefore, the psychological need to become anything other than who you are already is no longer there. In the world, on the level of your life situation, you may indeed become wealthy, knowledgable, successful, free of this or that, but in the deeper dimension of Being you are compete and whole _now._ 

  

_In that state of wholeness, would we still be able or willing to pursue external goals?_

  

Of course, but you will not have illusory expectations that anything or anybody in the future will save you or make you happy. As far as your life situation is concerned, there may be things to be attained or acquired. That’s the world of form, of gain and loss. Yet on a deeper level you are already complete, and when you realise that, there is a playful, joyous energy behind what you do. Being free of psychological time, you no longer pursue your goals with grim determination, driven by fear, anger, discontent, or the need to become someone. Nor will you remain inactive through fear of failure, which to the ego is loss of self. 

  

You don’t seek permanency where it cannot be found: in the world of form, of gain and loss, birth and death. You don’t demand that situations, conditions, places, or people should make you happy, and then suffer when they don’t live up to your expectations. 

  

When this is your state of Being, how can you not succeed? You have succeeded already.

### **Chapter 4: Mind Strategies For Avoiding The Now**

**The Inner Purpose Of Your Life’s Journey**

  

When you are on a journey, it is certainly helpful to know where you are going or at least the general direction in which you are moving, but don't forget: The only thing that is ultimately real about your journey is the step that you are taking at this moment. That's all there ever is.

  

Your life's journey has an outer purpose and an inner purpose. The outer purpose is to arrive at your goal or destination, to accomplish what you set out to do, to achieve this or that, which of course, implies future. But if your destination, or the steps you are going to take in the future, take up so much of your attention that they become more important to you than the step you are taking now, then you completely miss the journey's inner purpose, which has nothing to do with _where_ you are going or _what_ you are doing, but everything to do with _how._ It has nothing to do with future but everything to do with the quality of your consciousness at this moment. Your outer journey may contain a million steps; your inner journey only has one: the step you are taking right now. As you become more deeply aware of this one step, you realize that it already contains within itself all the other steps as well as the destination.

  

_Does it matter whether we achieve our outer purpose, whether we succeed or fail in the world?_

  

It will matter to you as long as you haven’t realised your inner purpose. After that, the outer purpose is just a game that you may continue to play simply because you enjoy it. The sooner you realise that your outer purpose cannot give you lasting fulfilment, the better. When you have seen the limitations of your outer purpose, you give up your unrealistic expectation that it should make you happy and you make it subservient to your inner purpose.

**Chapter 7: Portals Into The Unmanifested**

  

**Chapter 8: Enlightened Relationships**

  

The reason why the romantic love relationship is such an intense and universally sought-after experience is that it seems to offer liberation from a deep-seated state of fear, need, lack and incompleteness that is part of the human condition in its unredeemed and unenlightened state. There is a physical as well as psychological dimension to this state.

  

On the physical level, you are obviously not whole, nor will you ever be: You are either a man or a woman, which is to say, one-half of the whole.

  

On the psychological level, as 

  

If you cannot be at ease with yourself when you are alone, you will seek a relationship to cover up your unease. You can be sure that the unease will then reappear in some other form within the relationship, and you will probably hold your partner responsible for it. But do you need to have a relationship with yourself at all? Why can’t you just _be_ yourself? When you have a relationship with yourself, you have split yourself into two: “I” and “myself” subject and object. That mind-created duality is the root cause of all unnecessary complexity, of all problems and conflict in your life. In the state of enlightenment, you _are_ yourself –– “you” and “yourself” merge into one. You do not judge yourself, you do not feel sorry for yourself, you are not proud of yourself, you do not love yourself, you do not hate yourself, and so on. The plus caused by self-reflective consciousness is healed, its curse removed. There is no “self” that you need to protect, defend or feed anymore.
