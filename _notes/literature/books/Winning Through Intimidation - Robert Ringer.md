Successful men rarely know the real reasons for their success, even though they think they know. This is caused by the fact that they’re too close to the forest to see the tress. 

Why do people dream up all of those unworkable success rules?

1. Because of the brainwashing of society, successful men like everyone else, naturally absorb the “success” myths handed down over the years, even though they may not actually practice them. As a result, a “conditioned-response” pattern develops whereby they automatically regurgitate phrases about “positive mental attitude” and “working hard, long hours” when asked how they attained they lofty stations in life.

2. Society – that same menacing abstract entity – also manages to make most successful people feel guilty about their success, at least subconsciously. As a result, they’re almost afraid to outwardly acknowledge the realities of how they really made their money.

3. Cases of authors of “how to” books have, for commercial reasons, purposely withheld the realities of their success.  Some of the more popularly known “success” rules are much easier to sell than reality. 

**Theory Of Sustenance Of A Positive Attitude Through The Assumption Of A Negative Result**                                                                               

Don’t enter a sales situation feeling that you can’t make the sale. Realistically assume that he won’t make the sale. The difference is subtle. Armed with this preparedness and confidence, you can then go into each selling situation hoping for the best, but realistically assuming the worst. The only way to guard yourself against having your ego. self-image and belief shattered is to be mature and rational enough to acknowledge the reality that most deals simply do not close. 

**Uncle George Theory**

Keeping relativity and diminishing returns in mind – and all other things being equal – that if you keep your nose to the grindstone and work hard, long hours, you’re guaranteed to get only one thing in return: _OLD!_

Hard work will not _prevent_ you from being successful, assuming you don’t go beyond the point of diminishing returns. The theory only points out that hard work – aside from the fact that it’s relative to begin with – will not, of and by itself, _assure_ a person of success. 

**Theory Of Reality**

Reality isn’t the way you wish things to be, nor the way they appear to be, but the way they actually are. You either acknowledge reality and use it to your benefit or it will automatically work against you. Most people wish the game of business took place on a nursery school playground; they reality, however, is that game is played in a vicious jungle. 

**Theory Of Relativity**

Few people take the trouble to consider facts in a relative light. You cannot logically decide upon a course of action (or inaction) with regard to anything unless it has first been carefully defined. People go through life allowing themselves to be constantly intimidated by vague words and statements that are meaningful only when examined in the light of their relativity. 

**Theory Of Relevance**

No matter how interesting something is, no matter how true it is, or no matter how much it might please you, the primary fact to consider is whether or not it’s relevant to what you’re trying to accomplish. It also states that it’s important to work only on those things that you do recognise as being relevant. Qualify everything by first asking yourself whether or not it would help you to earn, and receive, income.

**Thirty Year Theory**

Most people tend to block from their conscious minds the reality that they’re going to die–and in a relatively short period of time, at that. Go after all you can get, as quickly as you can get it, because you acknowledge the reality that your time for doing so is limited.

**Ice Ball Theory**

It is ridiculous to take yourself too seriously, because years from now it wouldn’t make any difference anyway. It may seem a contradiction to the “Thirty Year Theory”, however it goes hand-in-hand with that theory. It eliminates ulcers and headaches and makes it possible to enjoy those last “thirty years” even when things aren’t going exactly as you’d like them to. In the game of business, this attitude puts you at a decided advantage over opponents who tend to view every deal as life or death; consequently, they press for results at crucial moments when you, on the other hand, are able to calmly maintain your objectivity. And as you’ve seen many times through your own experience, the harder someone presses for a result, the less likely it is that he will obtain that result.

You might ask, “If life is just a game, why play so hard to win?” To that I would answer, “Heck, if it _is_ only a game, why _not_ have some fund and try to win?” If it is a game there’s no sense in viewing each move a slide or death; there’s no reason to be afraid to be aggressive or take chances. 

**Important knowledge acquired prior to entering business**

All member of the “Discouragement Fraternity”had one thing in common: they are full of baloney. A guy who tries to impress upon a newcomer how tough his business is, really is only attempting to bolster his own ego because of lack of actual accomplishment.

**Tortoise And Hare Theory**

Don’t tell me how fast you get out of the starting blocks; I’m only interested in where you are when the race is over. Battle are for ego-trippers; wars are for money-grippers. It’s not so important to be the life of the part or the centre of attention in a crowd. The important thing is what happens after the party is over; the real advancement is made when you go one-to-one with a person behind closed  doors.

**Organic Chemistry Theory**

Don’t allow yourself to be intimidated by know-it-alls who thrive on bestowing their knowledge on insecure people. Put cotton in your ears aand blinders next to your eyes, and trudge aged with the confidence that whether or not someone else “knows it all” isn’t really relevant; the only thing that’s relevant is what _you_ know and what _you_ do. What someone else knows, or doesn’t know, will not affect your cusses one way or another. 

**Three Types Of People In Business**

These three people are the only types that exist, with one qualification: they do not include persons who stand to directly benefit as a result of your earning, and receiving, income. The latter type of exception is rare and will stand out like a sore thumb on those few occasions when it does exist. 

Where you’re concerned, collecting a commission should be your objective, and selling the solution should be kept in its proper perspective: it is only a means to an end (receiving a commission).

*Type Number One*: This type lets you know from the outset–either through his words or actions, or both–that he’s out to get all of your chips. He then follows through by attempting to do just that.

*Type Number Two*: This type assures you that he’s not interested in getting your chips, and he usually infers that he wants to see you get everything “that’s coming to you”. He then follows through just like Type #1, and attempts to grab all of your chips anyway.

*Type Number Three*: This type also assures you that he’s not interested in getting any of your chips, but, unlike Type #2, he sincerely means it. That, however, is where the difference ends; due to any one of a number of reasons–ranging from his own bungling to his personal standards for rationalising what’s right and wrong–he, like Types #1 and #2, still ends up trying to grab your chips. 

In business, no one ever does anything for anybody else without expecting to gain something in return. 

**Organising My Philosophy And Making Preparations For Applying It**

**Leapfrog Theory**

A person has no legal or moral obligation or, for that matter, logical reason to “work his way up through the ranks.” It says, in fact, that every person has the inherent right to “self-proclaim”– to announce, at any time he chooses, that he is on any level he chooses to be on.

The quickest way to the top is not by fighting your way _through_  the pack; the quickest way is to leapfrog _over_ the pack and simply take it upon yourself to proclaim that you’re above it. Regardless of what anyone tells you, you do have the right to self-proclamation. There is a catch, however: if you are not prepared to be above it, then, in spite of the fact that you make such a proclamation, the realities of the business world will knock you right back into the pack in a very short period of time.

Without authority from anyone else – and without being saddled by mystical “guilt feelings” or “moral obligations” – you simply take it upon yourself to begin operating on a higher level. You don’t wait for the industry, society, or some other abstract entity to christen you a “heavyweight” in your business.

The problem most people have in reaching their objectives revolve around the fact that they constantly allows themselves to be intimidated. 

**Theory Of Intimidation**

The results a person obtains are inversely proportionate to the degree to which he is intimidated. 

**Posture Theory**

It’s not what you say or do that counts, but what your posture is when you say or do it. 

Abstract power; image, respect

Real power; wealth, legal tools

Performance power: execution.

In _any_ type pursuit in life, you are “co-brokering” if you avoid the arena – the place where it’s all happening – choosing instead to “work” with your counterparts. 

I not only had to be above being “just another broker,” but I had to be beyond even being asked who I was. I had to be so far removed from the rest of the pack that the owner would be too intimidated to ask such a question. 

The calling card was specifically created to accomplish two objectives: the first was to eliminate the question of who I was; the second was to make it almost impossible for an owner to forget me, so that if and when he ever denied to sell his property, the chances were good that he’d contact The Tortoise.

Thus, ideally, before the owner of a property asked me to explain who I was, I took the initiative and suggested that I send him some information about myself before getting into any of the details regarding his property. Once again this was a technique that separated me from the rest of the pack because it was the antithesis of how a real estate salesman normally talks to an owner. Now it was The Tortoise who was being casual, as though no one deal were that important; it was the Tortoise who was suggesting that the owner learn something about him before proceeding further, rather than stuttering and stammering in an effort to justify his very existence to the owner. 

Obviously, anyone who didn’t feel that it was necessary even to mention his name of the front cover or first two pages of the brochure must be _somebody._ 

The number one cause of failure in any field of endeavour is the inability to recognise and/or refusal to acknowledge reality; and yet another important reality when it comes to working on the sales of anything large is the fact that the majority of deals simply are not makable. Therefore, as I became more and more experienced, I also became more and more selective as to the properties I worked on. 

**Makable Deal Theory**

This theory points out the efficiency of expending your efforts in working hard to find a few markable deals, rather than working hard on an endless number of unsalable deals and clinging to the faint hope that you’ll somehow close one. I concentrated on find that one good deal, rather than working on thirty bad ones and adhering to the prayer that luck and the law of averages would eventually bring about a positive result. 

First intimdtidation had been when I initially called the owner and suggested some information about myself before we discuss his property in details; the second was when he received the Earth brochure; now I was telling him that I was going to travel hundreds, or perhaps thousands, of miles to personally inspect his property, and that I could not “make any commitment” until I had completed the inspection. Obviously I was “somebody”. 

Here was a real estate developer who for laughs had long enjoyed such knee-slapping pastimes as pounding bamboo shoots under real estate salesmen’s fingernails, throwing bones in the middle of a group of ten or twelve starving co-brokers, and any number of equally enjoyable “kick the salesman” type torture games. Now he sat in his office waiting for his first big meeting with the “expert from afar” who had already intimidated him no less than three times; after his long wait I certainly didn’t want to disappoint him. I marched into his office, impeccably dressed – the usual black briefcase in hand – and was followed by an entourage of anywhere from one to three assistants carrying calculators, extension cords, mortgage rate books, and a variety of other materials and equipment that might be needed. 

The main reason for bringing my traveling office with me, as I’ve already pointed out, was to be certain that nothing was left to chance. As a bonus, however, I also found this technique to be very intimidating; it improved my image still more, and thus further contributed to my posture. 

**Fiddle Theory**

The longer a persona fiddles around with something, the greater the odds that the result will be negative. In the case of a sale, the longer it takes to get to the point of closing, the greater the odds that it will never close. 

**Boy-Girl Theory**

Every person wants what he can’t have and does not want what he can have. 

No matter how important a man may be, he’ll usually want the deal he can’t have and won’t want the deal he can have. 

The nearer a deal go to the point of closing - the point where it would become unavailable - the more the other “buyers” - both serious and non-serious - imagined they wanted it.

**Better Deal Theory** 

Before a person closes any kind of deal - including marriage - he always worries about the fact that there may be a better deal dow the road. It’s an uncontrollable instinct: at the last moment, the thought has to at least occur to a person that he might be missing out on a better deal somewhere else.

**Bluff Theory**

The best way to bluff is _not_ to bluff. He was always prepared to walk away from any deal because there was no one deal that he needed. When he threatened to walk away from a deal, he really meant it.
