A [fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy "Fallacy") is reasoning that is logically [invalid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_(logic) "Validity (logic)"), or that undermines the logical validity of an argument. All forms of human communication can contain fallacies. This is a list of well-known fallacies.

Because of their variety, fallacies are challenging to classify. They can be classified by their structure ([formal fallacies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_fallacy "Formal fallacy")) or content ([informal fallacies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informal_fallacy "Informal fallacy")). Informal fallacies, the larger group, may then be subdivided into categories such as improper presumption, faulty generalization, and error in assigning causation and relevance, among others.

The use of fallacies is common when the speaker's goal of achieving common agreement is more important to them than utilizing sound reasoning. When fallacies are used, the premise should be recognized as not well-grounded, the conclusion as unproven (but not necessarily false), and the argument as unsound.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies#cite_note-1)

## Formal fallacies

Main article: [Formal fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_fallacy "Formal fallacy")

A formal fallacy is an error in the [argument's form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_form "Argument form").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBunninYu2004[httpwwwblackwellreferencecompublictocnodeidg9781405106795_chunk_g97814051067957_ss1-95_%22formal_fallacy%22]-2) All formal fallacies are types of _[non sequitur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non_sequitur_(logic) "Non sequitur (logic)")_.

- [Appeal to probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_probability "Appeal to probability") – taking something for granted because it would probably be the case (or might possibly be the case).[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies#cite_note-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies#cite_note-4)
- [Argument from fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_fallacy "Argument from fallacy") (also known as the fallacy fallacy) – the assumption that, if a particular _argument_ for a "conclusion" is fallacious, then the _conclusion_ by itself is false.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies#cite_note-FOOTNOTECurtis[httpwwwfallacyfilesorgfallfallhtml_%22Fallacy_Fallacy%22]-5)
- [Base rate fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_rate_fallacy "Base rate fallacy") – making a probability judgment based on [conditional probabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_probability "Conditional probability"), without taking into account the effect of [prior probabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prior_probability "Prior probability").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies#cite_note-6)
- [Conjunction fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunction_fallacy "Conjunction fallacy") – the assumption that an outcome simultaneously satisfying multiple conditions is more probable than an outcome satisfying a single one of them.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies#cite_note-7)
- [_Non sequitur_ fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non_sequitur_(fallacy) "Non sequitur (fallacy)") – where the conclusion does not logically follow the premise.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies#cite_note-8)
- [Masked-man fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masked-man_fallacy "Masked-man fallacy") (illicit substitution of identicals) – the substitution of identical designators in a true statement can lead to a false one.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies#cite_note-FOOTNOTECurtis[httpwwwfallacyfilesorgillisubshtml_%22The_Masked_Man_Fallacy%22]-9)

### Propositional fallacies[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_fallacies&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Propositional fallacies")]

A propositional fallacy is an error that concerns compound propositions. For a compound proposition to be true, the truth values of its constituent parts must satisfy the relevant logical connectives that occur in it (most commonly: [and], [or], [not], [only if], [if and only if]). The following fallacies involve relations whose truth values are not guaranteed and therefore not guaranteed to yield true conclusions.  
Types of [propositional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositional_calculus "Propositional calculus") fallacies:

- [Affirming a disjunct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirming_a_disjunct "Affirming a disjunct") – concluding that one disjunct of a [logical disjunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction "Logical disjunction") must be false because the other disjunct is true; _A or B; A, therefore not B_.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWilson1999316-10)
- [Affirming the consequent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirming_the_consequent "Affirming the consequent") – the [antecedent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antecedent_(logic) "Antecedent (logic)") in an [indicative conditional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indicative_conditional "Indicative conditional") is claimed to be true because the [consequent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequent "Consequent") is true; _if A, then B; B, therefore A_.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWilson1999316-10)
- [Denying the antecedent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denying_the_antecedent "Denying the antecedent") – the [consequent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequent "Consequent") in an [indicative conditional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indicative_conditional "Indicative conditional") is claimed to be false because the [antecedent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antecedent_(logic) "Antecedent (logic)") is false; _if A, then B; not A, therefore not B_.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWilson1999316-10)

### Quantification fallacies[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_fallacies&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Quantification fallacies")]

A quantification fallacy is an error in logic where the quantifiers of the premises are in contradiction to the quantifier of the conclusion.  
Types of [quantification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantification_(logic) "Quantification (logic)") fallacies:

- [Existential fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_fallacy "Existential fallacy") – an argument that has a universal premise and a particular conclusion.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWilson1999317-11)

### Formal syllogistic fallacies[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_fallacies&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Formal syllogistic fallacies")]

[Syllogistic fallacies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllogistic_fallacy "Syllogistic fallacy") – logical fallacies that occur in [syllogisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllogisms "Syllogisms").

- [Affirmative conclusion from a negative premise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirmative_conclusion_from_a_negative_premise "Affirmative conclusion from a negative premise") (illicit negative) – a categorical [syllogism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllogism "Syllogism") has a positive conclusion, but at least one negative premise.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWilson1999317-11)
- [Fallacy of exclusive premises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy_of_exclusive_premises "Fallacy of exclusive premises") – a categorical syllogism that is invalid because both of its premises are negative.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWilson1999317-11)
- [Fallacy of four terms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy_of_four_terms "Fallacy of four terms") (_quaternio terminorum_) – a categorical syllogism that has four terms.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPirie2006133%E2%80%93136-12)
- [Illicit major](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illicit_major "Illicit major") – a categorical syllogism that is invalid because its major term is not [distributed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_of_terms "Distribution of terms") in the major premise but distributed in the conclusion.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWilson1999317-11)
- [Illicit minor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illicit_minor "Illicit minor") – a categorical syllogism that is invalid because its minor term is not distributed in the minor premise but distributed in the conclusion.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWilson1999317-11)
- [Negative conclusion from affirmative premises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_conclusion_from_affirmative_premises "Negative conclusion from affirmative premises") (illicit affirmative) – a categorical syllogism has a negative conclusion but affirmative premises.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWilson1999317-11)
- [Fallacy of the undistributed middle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy_of_the_undistributed_middle "Fallacy of the undistributed middle") – the middle term in a categorical syllogism is not distributed.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWilson1999316%E2%80%93317-13)
- [Modal fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_fallacy "Modal fallacy") – confusing necessity with sufficiency. A condition X is necessary for Y if X is required for even the possibility of Y. X does not bring about Y by itself, but if there is no X, there will be no Y. For example, oxygen is necessary for fire. But one cannot assume that everywhere there is oxygen, there is fire. A condition X is sufficient for Y if X, by itself, is enough to bring about Y. For example, riding the bus is a sufficient mode of transportation to get to work. But there are other modes of transportation – car, taxi, bicycle, walking – that can be used.
- [Modal scope fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_scope_fallacy "Modal scope fallacy") – a degree of unwarranted necessity is placed in the conclusion.

- [Begging the question](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Begging_the_question "Begging the question") (_petitio principii_) – using the conclusion of the argument in support of itself in a premise (e.g.: saying that smoking cigarettes is deadly because cigarettes can kill you; something that kills is deadly).[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies#cite_note-47)[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies#cite_note-48)
    - Loaded label – while not inherently fallacious, the use of evocative terms to support a conclusion is a type of [begging the question](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Begging_the_question "Begging the question") fallacy. When fallaciously used, the term's connotations are relied on to sway the argument towards a particular conclusion. For example, an organic foods advertisement that says "Organic foods are safe and healthy foods grown without any pesticides, herbicides, or other unhealthy additives." Use of the term "unhealthy additives" is used as support for the idea that the product is safe.[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies#cite_note-49)
- [Circular reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_reasoning "Circular reasoning") (_circulus in demonstrando_) – the reasoner begins with what they are trying to end up with (e.g.: all bachelors are unmarried males).
- [Fallacy of many questions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loaded_question "Loaded question") (complex question, fallacy of presuppositions, loaded question, _plurium interrogationum_) – someone asks a question that presupposes something that has not been proven or accepted by all the people involved. This fallacy is often used rhetorically so that the question limits direct replies to those that serve the questioner's agenda. (E.g., "Have you or have you not stopped beating your wife?".)

### Faulty generalizations[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_fallacies&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Faulty generalizations")]

[Faulty generalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faulty_generalization "Faulty generalization") – reaching a conclusion from weak premises.

- [Accident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident_(fallacy) "Accident (fallacy)") – an exception to a generalization is ignored.[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPirie20065-50)
    - [No true Scotsman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_true_Scotsman "No true Scotsman") – makes a generalization true by changing the generalization to exclude a counterexample.[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFlew1984%22No-true-Scotsman_move%22-51)

- [Overwhelming exception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overwhelming_exception "Overwhelming exception") – an accurate generalization that comes with qualifications that eliminate so many cases that what remains is much less impressive than the initial statement might have led one to assume.[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFischer1970[httpsarchiveorgdetailshistoriansfallac0000fiscpage127_127]-56)
- [Thought-terminating cliché](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought-terminating_clich%C3%A9 "Thought-terminating cliché") – a commonly used phrase, sometimes passing as folk wisdom, used to quell [cognitive dissonance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance "Cognitive dissonance"), conceal lack of forethought, move on to other topics, etc. – but in any case, to end the debate with a cliché rather than a point.

### Questionable cause[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_fallacies&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Questionable cause")]

[Questionable cause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionable_cause "Questionable cause") is a general type of error with many variants. Its primary basis is the confusion of association with causation, either by inappropriately deducing (or rejecting) causation or a broader failure to properly investigate the cause of an observed effect.

- _[Cum hoc ergo propter hoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cum_hoc_ergo_propter_hoc "Cum hoc ergo propter hoc")_ (Latin for 'with this, therefore because of this'; correlation implies causation; faulty cause/effect, coincidental correlation, correlation without causation) – a faulty assumption that, because there is a correlation between two variables, one caused the other.[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPirie200641-57)
    - _[Post hoc ergo propter hoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_hoc_ergo_propter_hoc "Post hoc ergo propter hoc")_ (Latin for 'after this, therefore because of this'; temporal sequence implies causation) – X happened, then Y happened; therefore X caused Y.[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDamer2009180-58)
    - [Wrong direction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrong_direction "Wrong direction") (reverse causation) – cause and effect are reversed. The cause is said to be the effect and vice versa.[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGula2002135-59) The consequence of the phenomenon is claimed to be its root cause.
    - [Ignoring a common cause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignoring_a_common_cause "Ignoring a common cause")
- [Fallacy of the single cause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy_of_the_single_cause "Fallacy of the single cause") (causal oversimplification[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDamer2009178-60)) – it is assumed that there is one, simple cause of an outcome when in reality it may have been caused by a number of only jointly sufficient causes.
- [Furtive fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furtive_fallacy "Furtive fallacy") – outcomes are asserted to have been caused by the malfeasance of decision makers.
- [Magical thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical_thinking "Magical thinking") – fallacious attribution of causal relationships between actions and events. In [anthropology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropology "Anthropology"), it refers primarily to cultural beliefs that ritual, prayer, sacrifice, and taboos will produce specific supernatural consequences. In [psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology "Psychology"), it refers to an irrational belief that thoughts by themselves can affect the world or that thinking something corresponds with doing it.

#### Statistical fallacies[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_fallacies&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Statistical fallacies")]

- [Gambler's fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler%27s_fallacy "Gambler's fallacy") – the incorrect belief that separate, independent events can affect the likelihood of another random event. If a fair coin lands on heads 10 times in a row, the belief that it is "due to the number of times it had previously landed on tails" is incorrect.[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDamer2009186-61)
    - [Inverse gambler's fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_gambler%27s_fallacy "Inverse gambler's fallacy") – the inverse of the gambler's fallacy. It is the incorrect belief that on the basis of an unlikely outcome, the process must have happened many times before.
- [p-hacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-hacking "P-hacking") – belief in the significance of a result, not realizing that multiple comparisons or experiments have been run and only the most significant were published

- [Argument from silence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_silence "Argument from silence") (_argumentum ex silentio_) – assuming that a claim is true based on the absence of textual or spoken evidence from an authoritative source, or vice versa.[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies#cite_note-68)
- _[Ignoratio elenchi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignoratio_elenchi "Ignoratio elenchi")_ (irrelevant conclusion, missing the point) – an argument that may in itself be valid, but does not address the issue in question.[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies#cite_note-FOOTNOTECopiCohen1990[httpsarchiveorgdetailsintroductiontol00copipage105_105%E2%80%93107]-69)

### Red herring fallacies

A red herring fallacy, one of the main subtypes of fallacies of relevance, is an error in logic where a proposition is, or is intended to be, misleading in order to make irrelevant or false inferences.

[Red herring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_herring "Red herring") – introducing a second argument in response to the first argument that is irrelevant and draws attention away from the original topic (e.g.: saying "If you want to complain about the dishes I leave in the sink, what about the dirty clothes you leave in the bathroom?").[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDamer2009208-72) In [jury trial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_trial "Jury trial"), it is known as a [Chewbacca defense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chewbacca_defense "Chewbacca defense"). In political strategy, it is called a [dead cat strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_cat_strategy "Dead cat strategy"). _See also [irrelevant conclusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignoratio_elenchi "Ignoratio elenchi")._

Easily confused with the [association fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_fallacy "Association fallacy") ("guilt by association") below.
- [Appeal to authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_authority "Appeal to authority") (argument from authority, _argumentum ad verecundiam_) – an assertion is deemed true because of the position or authority of the person asserting it.[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies#cite_note-FOOTNOTEClarkClark200513%E2%80%9316-75)[[76]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWalton199728-76)
    - [Appeal to accomplishment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_accomplishment "Appeal to accomplishment") – an assertion is deemed true or false based on the accomplishments of the proposer. This may often also have elements of appeal to emotion (see below).
