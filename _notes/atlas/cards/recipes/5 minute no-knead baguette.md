The fastest, most foolproof method to make baguette at home. Only 5 minutes of work.

Makes two small baguettes about 15 inches long, about the same amount of bread as one regular size baguette. The recipe is scaled for 1 packet of active dry yeast, so you can easily scale it up if you want more loaves.

## Ingredients

- 475g bread flour
- 1 packet active dry yeast (7g)
- 1 tsp salt
- 365g filtered water

## Directions

1. Mix flour and salt in a bowl, then add yeast and water.
2. Combine with a wooden spoon until it just comes together (2 min).
3. Cover and let rise overnight (8-10h).
4. Move dough to a heavily floured surface or use a baking tray for easy cleanup. Scrape from the edges of the bowl to avoid collapsing the air bubbles.
5. Form into a one big rough oblong shape.
6. Cut dough in half lengthwise.
7. Transfer each half directly onto an oven rack with lined with parchment paper.
8. Pull ends to stretch into a rough baguette shape.
9. Bake at highest temperature your oven can go (ideally 500F or more) for 25 minutes on the lowest rack, with convection. Increase time if your oven cannot get that hot.

## Tips

- Preheat oven for ~15 minutes
- For big air pockets avoid pressing down on the dough at any stage.
- To create even more airy pockets, you can replicate the steam used in commercial ovens. Add a baking tray with water or ice cubes at the bottom of your oven right before you insert the baking rack with the dough.
