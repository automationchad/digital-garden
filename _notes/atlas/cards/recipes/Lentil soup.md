## Ingredients

- 2 yellow onion
- 2 large carrot
- 2 large zucchini
- 4 celery stalks
- 8 rashes of short cut bacon(optional)if vegetarians)
- 4 small peeled potatoes(optional)
- 800g peeled tomatoes or bottle of passata
- 16oz cup dry lentils(green or red)
- 1.4L veg or chicken stick cube

## Directions

1. Chop the vegetables and bacon into small pieces.
2. In a frying pan, heat olive oil and fry the vegetables and bacon until the onions are tender.
3. Add 1 tablespoon of tomato concentrate to the frying pan.
4. Fry on low heat for 1 minute.
5. If using dado, add it to the frying pan and fry it off.
6. Add 2 x 400g peeled tomatoes or a bottle of passata to the frying pan.
7. If using dado, pour in 1.4L of water. If not using dado use 1.4L of vegetable or chicken stock.
8. Bring to a boil.
9. If using dry lentils, add 1 1/2 cups to the frying pan and coat them in the mixture. Fry them off for a few minutes. If using canned lentils, add them towards the last 10 minutes of cooking time.
10. Simmer the mixture for 15 minutes or until the lentils are softening. Do not over boil them.
11. Season the mixture with pepper and check for salt. Be careful not to oversalt, as the bacon and cube may already provide sufficient saltiness.
12. Serve with crusty bread.
13. Check the fluid level, as the lentils will absorb water. You may need to top up a bit depending on the thickness you like.
14. If desired, add the skin and remnants of parmiggiano to add creaminess. Remove this before serving.
15. Remember not to oversalt, as you can always add more later if needed.
