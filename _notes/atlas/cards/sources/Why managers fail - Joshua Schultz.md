1. Multiplying Great individual contributors have the potential to multiply their effectiveness and find personal accomplishment in the process... If they realize that worked at one level, won't work at this level. They must be willing to change approaches.

2. Build a method, not an output Where before an IC would focus on outputs and results A manager must focus on methods, systems, and processes. They must develop systems that can create the outputs... and then manage the system and adherence.

3. Focusing directly on people will result in extreme frustration for new managers as: - team won't pick things up fast enough - quality will deteriorate - team will always be falling apart and on edge

4. When there is an issue, fix the system Its is slower on the front end to build and fix via the system, rather than shortcut directly to the ouput. Productive people struggle with this. However, the backend compounding and scalability are unbeatable.

5. Moving from Individual Contributor to Management requires a change in mindset. It requires you to step up a level, and control the processes that create the outputs, rather than the outputs themselves.
