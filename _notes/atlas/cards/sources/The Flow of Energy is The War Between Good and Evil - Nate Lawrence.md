### Digestion of food, thoughts, emotions, and experience, are what allow for higher consciousness and the propagation of good.

# A Guiding Principle.

Ultimately, the things that lead to growth and expansion of consciousness promote the flow of energy through an organism.  
  
In a literal sense, this is the highest spiritual good…

---

## Higher Consciousness

Higher consciousness is flow, constant change, free flowing energy, ultimately good.

## Lower Consciousness

Evil, or lower consciousness, is anything that turns an organism away from good. It’s the need for things to be static, one particular way, and is what leads towards decay. This lowers our energy production rather than promotes the flow towards higher levels.

## Where things go wrong.

If energy gets stuck at any stage of it’s flow, things will go wrong… A blockage creates a buildup of energy that needs to be pushed through the system. At the stage of digestion, this is negative or toxic energy that needs to be digested and excreted.

> Digestion of food, thoughts, emotions, and experience, are what allow for higher consciousness and the propagation of good.

When things get stuck, not properly digested, energy become static, allowing for the propagation of evil.

Anxiety, depression, inaction, digestive issues, bacterial overgrowth, and any health issue for that matter, can be seen as literal propagation of evil or bad energy. Ultimately, these issues all come back to low energy production.

Essentially, not enough energy of good, light, and abundance

This war is waged through an unnatural exposure to things we were NOT meant to live with.

## The environment.

Synthetic substances, xenoestrogens[^1], endocrine disrupters[^2] EMFs[^3] and other unnatural stressors in our environment oppose the natural energy production of growth and expansion. Our environment is so bad today that it is no wonder why everyone has become sick and nihilistic.

Our environment was modified to support this, and it’s to the point where it's hardly possible to be able to perceive this.

These toxins are quite literally turning us away from our intuition, our faculties, and good; through making us sick, impairing our ability to think, and lowering our consciousness.

This is legitimately what evil is. We are quite literally being exposed to evil.

## The turning point…

Wouldn’t it be natural to have autonomy, take action, cope with stress effectively, not deal with chronic illness? Wouldn’t it be natural for life to expand? Hasn’t it done so all these billions of years?

Yes, it has. _Up until now..._

I think this is a clear sign we’re at an important point.

I understand this may all sound extreme, but I think it's important to understand that the physical and mental illnesses that we're currently dealing with are much deeper than “health.” This is the war between higher consciousness: good, love and light, vs lower consciousness: evil, fear and darkness. 

There is no way to explain this other than evil energy, there is nothing "natural" about the issues we’re facing in society today…

---

## What caused this?

As humans, I think that there’s no way of knowing why this is the circumstance that we face, but we must simply wage the war against evil.

Trying to understand how evil emerged is simply pointless. I truly believe that this just comes back to the idea of “Adam and Eve”, and the role that religion plays is to serve as a tool into understanding how to cope with this condition. In my eyes, no scientific or atheistic view seems to have a better explanation for this “war.”

If the universe truly needs perfect balance, yin and yang, good and evil, and if everything is one, then why does consciousness seem to be decaying?

Average IQ test scores continue to decline, fertility is plummeting, depression and learned helplessness is becoming ubiquitous.

I truly believe that the advent of AI is the turning point in the war between higher and lower consciousness. If human consciousness created AI, because they had a desire to create and expand, why would humans create something that could possibly replace the need for human existence?

I think this is a clear sign that we need a religious explanation for these circumstances and this is proof that the universe is not in fact “perfectly balanced” as we may have been led to believe. I think that this is where the true beauty of higher consciousness can get lost.

We’ve all felt what true _bad_ feels like, and we’ve all felt what true _good_ feels like, and when life tends to be going the best, things feel like they tend towards _good._ The _bad_ simply plays it’s role in affirming the _good._

_Bad_ serves as a stimulus towards the expansion of life. To grow you need a stimulus, otherwise things would be static, akin to the conditions which propagate evil.

Where I have arrived at is that in order to protect higher consciousness, evil _is_ in fact needed…

But it must be controlled, not balanced.

Things _must_ tend towards good, and expansion must be promoted by adequate stimulus, but then **nothing** more.

Evil must be controlled.

Life must favor higher consciousness.

## Healing is possible.

Personally, through becoming sensitive to all these factors, I’ve recently started to _acutely_ feel just how deep these things go, and if you’ve ever experienced any chronic issues, I’m sure you understand this as well. Never did I think that what I put in my body was quite as important as "the war between good and evil" until I started experiencing digestive issues. You quickly understand just how dark you can become when evil is literally stuck, propagating inside you. This isn’t just digestion of food, but the digestion of emotions, experiences, and thoughts as well. 

> _Anything_ that impairs digestion and decompression from stressors _must_ be avoided.

The higher our energy reservers are, the better we can withstand toxins in the environment, both physically and mentally.

> _“The degenerative diseases can begin in the earliest years of life, but because aging, like growth, is a developmental process, it's never too late to start the corrective process." -Raymond Peat

Until you regain your orienting reflex, autonomy, and ability to listen to your intuition rather than what those in power force upon you, survival is difficult.

_Higher consciousness must be protected, at all costs._

Our job is to wage the war against evil. Live in accordance with nature, say yes to life, and ultimately, follow your intuition.  
  
_This is how we protect higher consciousness…_
