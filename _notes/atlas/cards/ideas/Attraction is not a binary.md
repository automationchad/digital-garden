Have you ever felt put off or simply _not attracted_ to someone you’re with? But still think you’re good together and want to be with them?

You might have an incredibly compatible, functional, healthy, respectful relationship but without desire and passion something always feels amiss.

No one talks about actively fostering attraction and desire in relationships bc the s**ubconscious assumption** is that they're **meant to be instinctive and innate**. Either you're into him or you're not. Either she likes you for who you are or she doesn't. It's almost a matter of pride to expect someone to take you as you are.

After talking to a bunch of people about a relatively taboo subject how attracted are you actually to the person you’re with? I realized something: _attraction is not a binary._

It’s a spectrum! A cumulative function of moments. As you interact with anyone, there come moments that make you feel attracted to them (see the _men and women can never just be friends_ trope) Moments that their wit, grace, talent, or strength shine through. How he effortlessly handles an aggressive stranger, how her story captivates a room. An alluring cologne, the glint of a watch, a moment of generosity, a cheeky wink, a confident stride. I call this an _Appealing Momen_t, or an “app.”

There are also moments they are actively unattractive. A harmless but crass joke, a cringey gesture, a tacky outfit, less than stellar oral hygiene, a socially unaware comment. These things are often ridiculously minor and don’t have anything to do with innate personality, but over time they build up, especially if repeated. I call this a _Not Appealing Moment_ or “napp”

Everyone has both. The most alluring woman in the world might look really stupid as she sneezes.

How attracted you are to someone is a moment by moment thing. The more apps, the more you feel swept away by admiration and desire. A few napps in quick succession can make you feel like you could stand to spend some time away from them, actually.

There’s no framework for alerting someone to very minor things they do that you’re not a fan of - conversations like that are normally reserved for things that are a Big Deal, and it feels ridiculous to make a Big Deal out of very minor things.

But the overall success of a relationship is VERY dependent on these moments. The minor things actually affect your day to day happiness and passion more than crisis situations or life altering decisions, which are rare.

Compatibility and stability depend on you and your partners’ decision-making, crisis-handling, goals, and skills, but happiness comes from the compatibility of your everyday personas.

He might be a wonderful guy but it DOES matter if you don’t think he’s funny. It DOES matter if some of her mannerisms make you wince. It DOES matter if you wish he was more in shape and joked less about his bowl movements. A mature partner will be open to having this dialogue and doing the work to increase your mutual attraction.

From a single person’s perspective, these little moments probably impact your success in the dating market more than you realize. Little attractive things - like smelling nice or having good posture - are low hanging fruit with substantial impact on how the people in your life see you.

If you're lucky, you have honest, somewhat kooky, good natured, close friends who can alert you - if you ask - to your napps. And to apps you're missing out on. Obviously these things are subjective, but if you hear something over and over from multiple people it's probably good to pay attention.

Ofc if someone is of the opinion that something that's important to who you are is a napp, you shouldn't give it up. Being universally attractive is not the goal. You want someone who likes you for the real, vital you to be as attracted to you as possible.

It's not enough to have no napps, btw. You gotta have some apps or people see you as perfectly nice but they're just not into you, for some reason.
