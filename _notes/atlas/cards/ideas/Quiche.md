I often make a quiche on Sunday to eat for lunch every day that week. It’s decadent, quick (on the weekday, anyway), cheap, and variable enough that I’m not bored of it.

I make quiche using the method Thomas Keller describes in _Bouchon._ 2” custard, 12” steel tart ring. I make several weeks’ worth of pâte brisée at a time and freeze the extra portioned dough for efficiency.

## Fillings

Fillings should be concentrated and intense. I tend to prefer them to be vegetal. Root vegetables are usually too starchy.

- Fillings I’ve liked:
    
    - roasted asparagus
    - confit cherry tomatoes
    - roasted broccolini
    - “[Lorraine](http://gjbrecipes.blogspot.com/2015/08/tom-kellers-quiche-lorraine-bouchon.html)” (lardons and onion confit)
    - “Florentine” (sautéed spinach and shallot)
    - sautéed kale
    - roasted peppers or pepperonata
    - melted [[Leek]]
- Fillings that haven’t worked well:
    
    - fava beans (too mild, too much work)
    - plain onion confit (a bit bland, needs textural variation)
    - swiss chard (stems too watery and bland—maybe could work with just leaves)
    - mushrooms (too savory for lunchtime)
- Fillings to try:
    
    - sausage
