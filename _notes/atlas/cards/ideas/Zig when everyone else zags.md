Advancement often comes from defying the norm, not adhering to it. Consider the hallmarks of the majority: saddled with debt, glued to the news, physically unfit, binge-watching television, lost in the endless scroll of social media, and locked into monotonous daily routines. This isn't a roadmap to success; it's a blueprint for mediocrity.

The term 'rebel' carries a certain stigma, often colored by societal norms and media narratives. But rebellion isn't inherently negative; it signifies independent thought and action. And that's precisely what's needed to break away from the herd. The media and social frameworks often discourage self-interest and ambition, labeling them as conceit and selfishness. But let's be clear: these are not vices but virtues when channeled appropriately.

You'll rarely encounter a highly successful individual who isn't wholly absorbed in their pursuits, who isn't dissatisfied despite their achievements, constantly striving for more. This isn't a symptom of greed; it's a hallmark of ambition, the very quality required to attain exceptional success. People with grand plans develop the work ethic necessary to construct a grand life.

Many settle for mediocrity not because they lack capability, but because they lack belief in their own worth. They don't see themselves as potential kings of their own domain, so they don't act like it. They aim low, seeking just enough to get byâ€”enough money to eat, a roof over their heads, and modest pleasures. But ambition isn't about settling for the minimum; it's about striving for the maximum.

So, if you aspire for more, act like it. Defy the norms that keep the masses in check. Be selfish in your pursuits, be ambitious in your goals, and don't shy away from wanting more. Because only those who dare to want more ever get more.
