At the peer-to-peer level, [[Contradiction creates curiosity]]. This dynamic not only draws people into your orbit but also keeps them there, engaged and intrigued.

However, the real power of contradiction lies within yourself: it lets you consider multiple perspectives, fostering an environment where patterns and connections materialize naturally.

Lorenzo Laxamana, who straddles the worlds of mechanical engineering and system architecture, put it succinctly:

His point sparks a thought: there's value in being able to physically manipulate the components, understanding their tactile properties before you ascend to the abstract realm of system design.

This blend of hands-on and theoretical knowledge is potent, especially in the software realm. Many folks in this industry seem to bypass the phase of getting their hands dirty—tinkering with machinery, immersed in the grimy mechanics, embodying the concept of [[Pathemata mathemata]]. In other words, [[Understanding requires effortful engagement]], and [[Deep understanding requires detailed knowledge of fundamentals]] which I feel most computer engineers don't have.

These individuals often steep themselves in computational theory. While that's valuable for grasping the inner workings of computers, it fails to equip them with the ability to ingeniously stitch together different pieces of a business architecture.

In contrast, we (mechanical engineers) see the "Lego pieces" more clearly and intuitively grasp how they ought to be assembled. We're not just mechanical engineers; we're system architects.
