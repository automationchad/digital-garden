[Figma](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zF6yhcVZ2yT7xpRQTWBzstB) is an infinite, high-performance canvas with right-sized primitives for many kinds of visual thinking. Put more or less anything anywhere, copy stuff instantly, group and arrange hierarchically if you like. Duplicate a thousand elements to make an alternate. Create abstraction through components to avoid duplicative work. Collaboration built in. And so on.

It was created as a tool for user interface design, but through this lens it’s useful in many other contexts. Laying out a book (per [Craig Mod](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zE2UWpL4abqhk6iRRZdNTWu)); writing non-linear notes; possibly even editing a manuscript. In some senses you can think of it as an “upgraded” version of a big whiteboard wall.

It also has some interesting hints of interactivity. You can create “links” in artboards ([Figma’s copy and paste playground situates instructional media inside the context of use](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zQp36KQ3k8phqVba6ZMpNEm)). Inspired by this, [Michael Nielsen](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4JuirVwUcoGL4wZ8dM6Los) nerd sniped me into re-implementing the opening area of Myst in Figma. It was surprisingly pleasant to work with the spatial environment. No state, though, so you can’t really make Myst.
