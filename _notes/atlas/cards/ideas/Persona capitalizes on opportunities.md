Persona is all the attraction that comes from your outward behavior. In other words, Persona is all about how you act, and how those actions impact other people’s perception of you. This is essentially your ability to read social situations, adapt to those social situations, and manipulate them in your favor. It is your ability to make people like you and elicit favorable emotions in them. It is your ability to seduce and befriend. It is your game. Unlike Preselection, Persona does not provide opportunities. Instead, it allows you to _capitalize_ on them. It's the small moments added up. 

Persona in the business realm is about the image your company projects through its actions and communications, including its strategy to adapt and respond to different market situations. A business persona encompasses the style of leadership, the tone of marketing communications, and the customer service approach. Skilled businesses read the market's needs and demands adeptly and adapt their persona to suit different contexts, thereby capitalizing on the opportunities preselection brings to the table. Developing a strong, adaptive persona can foster relationships, build trust, and enhance your business's overall appeal to your target audience.
