## 000 - Knowledge Management


## 100 - Personal Management
[[§Thinking]] can galvanize my attention; the [[§Concepts]] can flavor it; and the [[Habits MOC]] speaks about how to direct it. 

Go to my [[⎈Life Map]] to brush up on [[My Virtues]] and more.

## 400 - Communications, Language, & Linguistics
A fun section of the library, the 400s contains the underrated and oft-maligned subject of [[§Rhetoric]]. And one cannot talk long about rhetoric without talking about [[⎈Language]], [[§Words]], and especially [[Figures MOC]]. Not too far behind is the [[⎈Leadership]].

## 500 - Natural Sciences

## 600 - Applied Sciences

- Film & TV | [[§Movies]] 
- Sports | 
- Music | 
- [[⎈Cooking]] | [[⎈Leisure]] 

## 800 - Literature

## 900 - History & Biography & Geography

- [[⎈Places]]
- [[⎈History]]

The [[§Art & Science Storytelling]] look at some great storytellers of history.
