[[Learning requires metacognition]], but environments can take some of that metacognitive burden off of learners’ shoulders.

In a classroom setting, teachers do much of the monitoring, evaluation, planning, and executive control. Of course, they sometimes do _too_ much of it, but in many situations, this can free students to focus on the material at hand.

On [Quantum Country](https://quantum.country/), our interleaved review sessions help readers notice when they’re not absorbing the material and give them a sense of ease when their memory is solid. The environment also plans and executes subsequent memory practice accordingly.

Games are particularly good at this:

- [[Games help players evaluate their developing skills]]
- [[Games help players make and adapt plans]]
