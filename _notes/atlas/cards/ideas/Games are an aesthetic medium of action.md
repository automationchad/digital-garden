If painting is an aesthetic medium of vision, music an aesthetic medium of sound, and cooking an aesthetic medium of taste, then games are an aesthetic medium of _action_, [Frank Lantz](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zPLafkamDFQ13mYvxRcwdoV) observes.

Games involve visuals and music, of course, but what really distinguishes them is that the player _acts._ Game designers can express a specific aesthetic experience by shaping players’ actions to cause them to have that experience (see [Enacted experience](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z92TGMiBsnraf5KXxSTNkBJ)).

In fact, games are really _the_ aesthetic medium of action. Immersive theater sometimes qualifies, but audience action is usually secondary. On certain trips, adventure tour guides are authoring an aesthetic medium of action, but such trips are usually more about observing than participating.
