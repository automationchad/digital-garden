Build from the _bottom-up_. You can’t think your way into the perfect creative business for yourself. Trying to plan your life from the top down is a recipe for unnecessary suffering. Instead, work from the bottom up. Let go of the need to have all the answers. Follow your intuition, experiment frequently, interact with the world, and make note of what works and what feels good. This is how you iterate your way into a business that fits you like a glove.
