Displacement activities are self-soothing activities which people (and animals) perform when theyâ€™re highly motivated to perform multiple behaviors, as well as when theyâ€™re unable to or uncertain how to proceed. The behaviors are also associated with stress and anxiety.

For example, people scratch their heads when theyâ€™re not sure which option to choose. Or they respond to urgent emails (or refresh social media) when theyâ€™re feeling anxious about challenging intellectual work: see also [[Culturally default behaviors fill spare time with othersâ€™ ideas]],Â [[People prefer doing to thinking]]. Animals tend to groom, preen, or scratch in similar situations.
