One of the largest problems we faced in [Tray.io](http://Tray.io) when trying to sell these deals was collecting project scopes from clients.

Itâ€™s understandable that there was so much process around this.

Humans have an innate dislike for uncertainty. 

Because we love predictability, we tend to try and analyze and plan things, and when we canâ€™t, we leave them till later, hoping that the right answer will emerge.

Yet we still find our requirements changing, either from internal stakeholder feedback from our prototypes, or from the feedback we get from users and external stakeholders when our system goes into production.

As a result, we find ourselves trying to analyze everything up-front, exhaustively checking and re-checking to make sure that nothing the business needed had been missed, then getting feedback on everything afterwards, until our whole process is bogged down withâ€¦well, **too much process**. See: [[Premature scaling can stunt system iteration]]

By then, of course, weâ€™ve made a lot of investments and commitmentsâ€¦

And if the discoveries we make show us that those investments and commitments are wrong, itâ€™s hard to undo them and turn them around.

**We as consultants are there to be problem solvers.**

Correctly, identifying what type of problem weâ€™re trying to solve for people will be the difference between success and failure as problem solvers.

The reason most deals do not close or clients are unhappy is because weâ€™ve misunderstood the true nature of the problems weâ€™re trying to solve.

We need to stop categorizing prospects by the company demographics that donâ€™t matter (revenue, headcount) and **START** categorizing by the _**type of problem**_ they are facing.

That doesnâ€™t mean we completely throw out the notion of company demographics like size, revenue and other hard number metrics â€” weâ€™d use these metrics for **quantitative** situations like cost estimates â€” BUT for problem solving which is more qualitative we CANNOT apply quantitative tools. See: [[Disorder is the domain in which we donâ€™t know which of the domains dominate, so we behave according to our preferred domain.]]

Following [[atlas/cards/ideas/The Cynefin framework]] allows us to qualitatively categorize the companies that we attract _**and**_ the problems they face incredibly easily.

Utilizing knowledge inappropriately in a specific context can lead to failure, and a prime example of this can be seen when attempting to bring an intelligent and authentic marketing approach to an industry that doesnâ€™t align with those principles. Consider the insurance industry, a sector largely operating on fueling fears rather than engaging peopleâ€™s rationality.

In this scenario, employing a marketing strategy rooted in intelligence misses the core mechanic of the industry, which is to capitalize on fear, often targeting individuals not necessarily driven by logic in their choices. Attempting to introduce a thoughtful, intelligent campaign here is not just inappropriate, but fundamentally flawed, because it disregards the prevailing method that this industry employs to secure clientele.

This isn't to say that there's no room for intelligent discourse in the industry, but a strategy solely centered on rational appeal is unlikely to resonate, given that the industry thrives on the proliferation of fear to create a demand for its products. Thus, an understanding of the intrinsic dynamics of a system or industry is vital to appropriately apply knowledge in a manner that aligns with the industryâ€™s established marketing narratives and consumer behaviors.
