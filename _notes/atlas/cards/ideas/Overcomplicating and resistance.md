Getting cute means whenever we’re over-engineering something because of procrastination. It's playing house.

Example: When you are focused on the size font on a website and spend time doing that instead of what you know is the work you should be doing.

It's the mental masturbation we do that prolongs the actual work.

What is procrastination? Resistance.

Here’s what you’ve got to understand about resistance.

It is created any time you make an activity a “should” ([[Beware a sense of “should”]]), a “must” or a “need”.

Buying things like an Apple Watch to track your fitness (besides it taking more time to configure the thing instead of just doing the workout) leads into an external tool to tell you to workout.

It goes from: “I work out to stay healthy because I want to be”…

To: “I work out because my Apple Watch told me I only burned 200 calories today”

"I should workout"

Why do you need external technology to motivate you to do the inner work?

Discipline is a misconstrued fantasy jargon word.

People achieve things either because it's fun or because they are divinely pulled by a vision that's deeply interwoven into the fabric of their being and ego. [[Non-coercive productivity]]

It creates [[Gumption]], and [[Gumption transcends willpower and confidence]]

If it's not either of these things, it won't get done.

Greg wakes up at 4am every morning because he needs business success to prove to himself that he's not an unlovable piece of shit.

He also hasn't done the dishes in his sink in eight weeks.

The narrative or vision fuels the action.

Discipline is just the narrative.

People often don’t lack “discipline” they lack a proper design and then don’t know how to discipline the decision.

If you're not "disciplined" around an action, it's because you don't have a story pushing or pulling you towards it.



If you don't have a story around it, it's not important to you.

So, why do you care about doing it if it's not important?
