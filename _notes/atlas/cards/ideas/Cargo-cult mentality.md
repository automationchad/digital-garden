Success comes from consistently getting the basics right. 

For a business, this means pricing that matches outcomes and recognizing the value. 

It means focusing on the work instead of abstract ideas like websites and logos. 

Avoid the "cargo cult mentality" of copying the surface elements (like slogans, culture, or office perks) of successful companies without understanding or implementing the underlying principles that truly drive success. 

Many people believe that mimicking successful companies will lead to similar outcomes, but this can actually harm critical thinking and genuine problem-solving. 

While it's tempting to emulate successful role models like Amazon or Apple, focusing only on high-level ideas without a solid operational foundation can distract from real issues like product-market fit, customer acquisition, or operational efficiency.
