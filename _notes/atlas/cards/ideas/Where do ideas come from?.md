    - The authors tested the hypothesis that a broad or narrow scope of perceptual attention engen- ders an analogously broad or narrow focus of concep- tual attention, which in turn bolsters or undermines creative generation

    - The present study examined the thesis that positive affect may serve to broaden the scope of attentional filters, reducing their selectivity.
    - Mirroring the broad attentional focus and enhanced creative problem solving during positive mood, individual differences in creative intelligence have been associated with decreased attentional filtering. For instance, creative individuals have been shown to exhibit less latent inhibition, a measurement of attentional decrements to stimuli deemed irrelevant (54).
