People don’t want to forget an idea or a conversation or a task or quote from a book, so they write it down in Evernote or something. What’s the purpose? Probably: “To make sure I don’t forget." Maybe: “Just writing it down helps me remember.”

In this conception, notes are a way to [Close open loops](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zFuk9QqspNYHAgvzZc33ZGH), not to accumulate insight. The “real” work happens outside the notes; the notes are just a reference system which stores information which might help, or a write-once pile of “messy” thoughts (Khoe).

These are not [[Evergreen notes]]. Most “storage-oriented” notes will never be useful again ([[Most people only take transient notes]]). More importantly, this framing misses that it’s possible for note-writing to _be_ the “real” work ([Evergreen note-writing as fundamental unit of knowledge work](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zR6RRbCfY5rFkiimFnaJZKB)).
