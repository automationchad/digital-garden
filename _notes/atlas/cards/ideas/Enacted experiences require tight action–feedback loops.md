To create an [[Enacted experience]], feedback loops need to be sufficiently tight to sustain the perception that participants are bringing about the experience. Tight feedback loops, in turn, require actions to be fairly fine-grained.

Consider choose-your-own-adventure books versus Infocom-style interactive fiction. The stakes feel much greater in the latter, but the medium is really quite similar, even though Zork runs on a computer. I suspect that my sense of “being one with Zork” comes from its finer-grained feedback loops and larger state space.
