Donâ€™t try to solve problems that are a byproduct of being in a good situation.

Avoid fixating on issues that arise from success you haven't yet achieved. This is like concerning yourself with the color of a Lamborghini you can't afford. For Motis Group, this means not dwelling on features such as setting a maximum purchase limit for clients. 

In the strategy landscape, it's misguided to prioritize the perks of success before securing the success itself. This is wasting resources. A smarter approach is to focus firmly on the current main goals, steering clear of tempting yet premature concerns.

Stay grounded, tackling the immediate, significant challenges head-on. Don't overcomplicate. Our path to the "Lamborghini" should be marked with genuine victories, not distractions based on future luxuries.

After achieving solid success, you'll have the standing to consider those finer points. This realistic approach entails making forward moves, not drifting into fantasy. Embrace this principle: maintain a tight focus on current, substantial challenges, disregarding the lesser issues tied to future success.
