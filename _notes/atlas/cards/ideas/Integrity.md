Integrity is doing the right thing when you think no one is watching.

- I do not give my word easily.
- Iâ€™m good enough to have the intention to deliver on it
- Strong enough to uphold it at all cost.

**Integrity is what I do, despite what they say they do.**

Integrity foregoes opportunism.

Ingratitude, desperation and predation all make up temptation - and temptation is the bane of integrity.
