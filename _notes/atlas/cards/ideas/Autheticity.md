**Authenticity** is a concept of personality in the fields of psychology, [existential psychotherapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_psychotherapy "Existential psychotherapy"), [existentialist philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existentialism "Existentialism"), and [[§Aesthetics|aesthetics]]. In existentialism, authenticity is the degree to which a person's actions are congruent with their [[My Virtues|values]] and desires, despite external pressures to social conformity. The [conscious Self](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness "Consciousness") comes to terms with the condition of _[Geworfenheit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrownness "Thrownness")_, of having been _thrown_ into an [absurd world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absurdism "Absurdism") (without values and meaning) not of their own making, thereby encountering external forces and influences different from and other than [the Self](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_self "Philosophy of self").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authenticity_(philosophy)#cite_note-2) A person’s lack of authenticity is considered *[[Bad faith]]* in dealing with other people and with one's self; thus, authenticity is in the instruction of the [[Oracle of Delphi]]: “[[Know thyself]].”
