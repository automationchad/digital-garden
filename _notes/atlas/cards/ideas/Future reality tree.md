## Solution Tree

If we take this action to solve our problem, what can we expect the ultimate outcome to be?

So many great ideas have collapsed for want of two crucial things:

1. Verification that the idea will actually work
2. Failure to successfully execute the change

The solution Tree addresses the first of these two things.

Success require three things:

1. Performance (the change has to do what is was intended to do)
2. Schedule (it has to happen sometime in the reasonably near future)
3. Cost (it must not break the budget)

[[The chief cause of problems is solutions]] â€” we tend to make things more difficult for ourselves in the future by not confirming that what we want to do will actually work and by failing to anticipate how our new idea could cause new, more or worse problems.

In not adopting a logical approach to solving a complicated problem:

1. The solution developed and agreed upon may not actually do much, if anything, to solve the problem.
2. The solution may create new , unanticipated problems that are as bad or worse than the original one.

### Negative Branch

Besides reaching our desired outcome, what new, potentially devastating effects might our choice of solutions have?
