I had a dream where I was in a prison that could be left at any time.

Everyone had aspirations to be great writers, but everyone couldnâ€™t see that they could leave the jail.

There were no fences.

No guards keeping them in.

When asked what their sentences were, they werenâ€™t too clear but they sounded self imposed.

This happened to meâ€¦instead of I happening to it.

People couldnâ€™t believe that I had been outside the walls.

It was like a college that people didnâ€™t WANT to leave more than anything.

We are writers of our own lives that live in self-imposed prisons.

The assumption we hold.

The beliefs we have.

Form a box around us, they define us.

But it can also trap us.
