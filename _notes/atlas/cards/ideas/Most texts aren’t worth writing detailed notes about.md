Writing good [[Evergreen notes]] about a book can take many hours. How can I possibly do this about everything I read? Well, I don’t. Most of what I read isn’t worth that kind of deep follow-up, except perhaps in isolated places where I was struck by something. But a small portion are worth careful re-reads, along with much writing and integration.

This note is an exhortation to self. It’s easy to feel a sense of duty, or obligation, or an impulse adjacent to [[Collecting material feels more useful than it usually is]]. This can turn reading into a chore. I want to write about what moves me, not what I “should” write about.
