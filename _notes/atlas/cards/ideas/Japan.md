- Purchase a Suica card on your iPhone wallet for local trains, and use it as a debit card at train station shops and to use trains. You can access it by going to your “Wallet” on iPhone and clicking the “+” button. Look for it there.
- When you grab a bite from a convenience store, avoid walking while eating. You must stand still and eat.
- People bow a lot, and while you don’t have to bow back, I always found myself doing a slight nod downward whenever saying thank you and goodbye.
- If an item is not on the menu, do not ask for it. Asking for something that is not on the menu can overcomplicate things, confuse people, and may not be received well.
- Some places will ask you to take your shoes off at the door, so always be mindful of checking before you just stroll in. Typically, you can tell because the rest of the restaurant will be raised from the small entry. Most places will have shoe lockers where you can store your shoes.
- Do not tip or offer to tip. Japanese people are very proud and view any extra money on top of the original amount as pity. If you want to thank them, get them non-monetary gifts, but do not pay them money.
- Use chopsticks instead of regular cutlery.
- There are vending machines for drinks everywhere.
- Some places might not let you in because you are not Japanese. Accept the fact that racism exists.
- Zoning is fantastic. You’ll have an entire district dedicated to just eating or shopping. You’ll have plenty of options if one doesn’t work out.
- Most restaurants won’t take reservations, but be mindful of the ones that do.
- When you buy a Japan Rail (JR) pass online (if you’re travelling long distances between different cities), you’ll have to go to a JR office to convert your order into an actual ticket. If you do get the JR pass, be sure to grab the ticket quickly out of the machine when you go through the entry gates. If you leave it for more than 5 seconds, the machine will swallow it, and getting a new one can be a hassle.
- Some trains have reserved seating which you can purchase in addition to the regular train ticket. There is also reserved seating which is first-come-first-served when you get onto the train.
- Japan is one big city with a couple of sights.
- Mainly, apartments are stacked together in cities.
- There is a great subway system, with trains every 4 minutes, so you can’t go wrong.
- Talking loudly on trains is frowned upon.
- Be efficient. When you’re done eating, leave.
- Bring a battery pack.
- Bring cash when dining out, as most restaurants are cash only.

Old lady running operation herself. Epitome of breakfast is an epresso and cigarettes. Kicked out disabled wheelchair person to make room for us. Menu consisted of drip coffee and toast with butter on it. Brought us grapefruit (gave me biggest piece because she said I was the bigger) and cut up toast with butter on it to apologise for it taking so long. No health regulations at all, kitchen was in shambles. Smoking indoors, entire place reeked of smoke.
