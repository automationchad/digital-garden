One of the most common expressions of conflict in any organizational system is resistance to change.

> “It ought to be remembered that there is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or more uncertain in its success, than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things. Because the innovator has for enemies all those who have done well under the old conditions, and lukewarm defenders in those who may do well under the new. This coolness arises partly from fear of the opponents, who have the laws on their side, and partly from the incredulity of men, who do not readily believe in new things until they have had a long experience of them.” — Niccolò Machiavelli

The Conflict Resolution Diagram smooths the path of change by anticipating and resolving potential (or real) conflicts before they can adversely affect the “new order of things”

## **Two Types of Conflict**

Because “conflict” has such a pejorative connotation, most people tend to think only of the overt indications of conflict mentioned earlier. But for the purpose of identifying and solving problems, it’s sometimes better to think in terms of “competing forces.” These competing forces are usually of two types: opposite conditions or different alternatives.

_**Opposite Conditions**_

In this situation, one force pushes us to _“do_ this.” The other force pushes us to _“not do_ this” (or to do something that is the diametric opposite). For example, one side of the conflict might tell us to “save money,” while the other side might say “spend money.” This particular conflict is inherent in the problem of reducing the federal budget, where one school of thought says “Spend money to stimulate the economy,” while the other says “Reduce federal spending to cut the deficit.”

_**Different Alternatives**_

This kind of conflict forces us to choose between two alternatives that are not opposite conditions but are, for some reason, mutually exclusive. This kind of conflict is inherent in any resource shortage. In other words, “We only have so much money; we can do either ‘A’ or ‘B,’ but we can’t do both.” This is a classic conflict condition: the choice between equally desirable alternatives that we can’t do at the same time. Any “either-or” situation implies a hidden conflict of this type.

### **Compromise, “Win-Lose” or “Win-Win”?**

When it comes to resolving conflict, there are three basic paths: _compromise, win-lose,_ and _win-win._ Though two of these may be necessary at times, only one is truly desirable. In a compromise, neither side gets everything it expected. In win-lose, one side gets what it expected—maybe more—while the other side doesn’t get what it expected—and maybe gets nothing. In a win-win, however, both sides get more than they expected.

_**Compromise**_

The first idea that almost everybody thinks of when a conflict or contention arises is, “Let’s split the difference—you take half, and I’ll take half.” If both sides are willing to live with a compromise, it’s probably the easiest and fastest way to resolve differences. But what if the conflict doesn’t have an acceptable compromise? That leaves two other alternatives.

_**“Win-Lose”**_

This type of resolution assumes that the situation is a zero-sum game: One side must win and the other side must lose. If I win, you can’t win, and vice-versa. This is okay—maybe even desirable—for athletic contests. But in big business, careers, interpersonal relationships—the “games of life”—it’s neither necessary nor desirable. All it does is create hard feelings and lasting resentment.

_**“Win-Win”**_

This is an ideal situation. When both sides win, nobody feels exploited. Both sides probably get more than they’d hoped for. And most important of all, good will is generated on both sides, which bodes well for the future of the relationship.

_**Objective**_

The objective of an Evaporating Cloud is essentially a common purpose. In a negotiation, for example, even though both sides may be at odds over some things, there is an elemental reason they are in the same room, at the same table, attempting to negotiate. Labor and management basically want the same thing—a profitable company—because it’s essential to the well-being of both sides. It’s their common purpose, or objective (see Figure 5.3). If an Intermediate Objectives Map has been constructed for the system in question—a _strategic_ IO Map—the goal articulated in that IO Map is usually a safe choice for the objective in an Evaporating Cloud.

**Requirements**

A requirement is a _necessary condition_—something that _must_ be satisfied in order to achieve the objective. Each requirement is necessary but not sufficient alone to achieve the objective. There may be many of these requirements, like spokes in a wheel, and in most cases these requirements don’t conflict with each other. They may even seem so benign that they’re often not noticed (see Figure 5.4).

For example, in order to have a profitable company, we might need to maximize sales revenue, control costs, or minimize inventory. We might have to create a popular product or service, lower operating costs, stabilize production, effectively market and sell, or establish other conditions important to profitability. There is no direct conflict here, and each of these requirements can be considered necessary, though not sufficient alone. In the accompanying example, the objective “A profitable company” depends on several requirements, two of which are “increase sales revenue” and “control costs” (see Figure 5.5). Requirements are often the critical success factors from an IO Map.

_**Prerequisites**_

Satisfying the necessary conditions, or requirements, usually demands some actions on our part—things that we must _do_—that are better defined and more specific. The action is _prerequisite_ to satisfying the requirement, so that’s what we call it—a prerequisite. (See Figure 5.6.)

In the preceding example, the requirement “increase sales revenue” might require the specific action “spend more money on advertising.” This specific action seems to be a prerequisite for satisfying the requirement “increase sales revenue.” But another requirement, controlling costs, would seem to demand a different prerequisite—_not_ spending more money (see Figure 5.7).

Immediately the conflict becomes apparent. On the one hand, we have to spend more money to satisfy one necessary condition. But on the other hand, we have to _not_ spend more money to satisfy another equally necessary condition. Both requirements are necessary conditions—by definition they can’t be in conflict with one another—however, the prerequisites we generate to satisfy them are.

So it’s at the prerequisite level that conflict usually occurs, where forces compete. Remember, not all prerequisites conflict; perhaps only two or three do. But these are usually enough to stall progress toward satisfying the requirements—the necessary conditions—that they support. And since _all_ the requirements are necessary to achieve the objective, failure to satisfy any one can prevent achievement of the objective. As few as two prerequisites in conflict with one another can “shortstop” the objective.

Even though there may be many requirements and an equal number of prerequisites, it’s the ones in conflict that we’re most interested in. That’s why the “pie” configuration pictured in Figure 5.8, though it effectively illustrates the whole objective/requirement/ prerequisite situation, is not as useful to us in resolving the conflict as is the “slice,” which

_**Assumptions**_

As with any of the Logical Thinking Process trees, the presence of an arrow indicates the existence of hidden underlying assumptions about the relationship between entities of the Evaporating Cloud. These assumptions are the key to unlocking the conflict. An assumption is a statement about reality that is accepted as true or valid without question or demand for proof. It’s likely that there are several assumptions underlying each arrow in an EC. Some of these assumptions are invariably valid.

_**Invalid Assumptions**_

But what makes assumptions so important to the conflict resolution process are not the valid assumptions, but the _invalid_ ones. They may never have been valid. Or, if they were, changes in the environment may have rendered them invalid. Resolving conflict or solving problems with an Evaporating Cloud calls upon us to expose _all_ the underlying assumptions we possibly can about the entire prerequisite-requirement-objective relationship and separate the ones that are invalid. You can expose assumptions by brainstorming, using the Crawford Slip Method1, or using some other means of idea generation.

**Injections: The Role of Invalid Assumptions**

Now the question arises: what shall we do with these invalid assumptions after we identify them? The answer is that they point the way to the direction of new ideas— potential solutions to break the conflict.

Take assumption 3, for example: “Spending more money is the ONLY way to increase sales revenue.” Doesn’t that statement virtually invite a challenge? Can’t you just hear a marketing expert say, “Wait a minute! We don’t have to spend more money on advertising. Instead we could...” And with the unstated end of that last sentence, an idea for breaking the conflict is born— an idea that increases revenue (R1) without the need to spend more money (P1).

Likewise, take a look at assumptions 8 or 9. While they may never be explicitly verbalized by anyone in a commercial organization, people clearly behave as though they subscribe to them, which implies that they _do_ drive behavior. But their validity is clearly questionable. No rational leader or manager in an organization could argue that failure to spend more money in some circumstances doesn’t have an adverse effect on the company as a whole.

Here are the key points to remember about Evaporating Clouds:

- In any conflict situation, there are usually five arrows indicating underlying assumptions.
- Each arrow implies the existence of at least one, but probably more, assumptions.
- Expose as many assumptions underlying each arrow as you can to:
    - Improve your chances of finding an easy one to invalidate, and
    - Open the range of potential solutions as wide as possible.
- The injections you develop to invalidate assumptions are ideas, not solutions. They should not be constrained by premature considerations of feasibility.
- In complex conflict situations, injections are likely to be conditions you want to create, rather than actions you expect to perform. Many separate actions may be necessary to achieve these conditions.

## **Articulate the Conflicting “Wants” of Each Side**

In most situations, stating the conflict is relatively easy. It is the issue that you are disputing with someone else, or the dilemma or choice you are facing if it is internal. The two positions in the conflict are recorded in the blanks labeled prerequisites 1 and 2.

The conflicting prerequisites can be either opposite conditions or different alternatives. To help articulate the prerequisites, verbalize them using “On one hand... on the other hand... .” Adjust the wording of the prerequisites until they make sense when read this way. Use action verbs (e.g. "do"), not conditions (e.g. "be" or "have").

Remember from our earlier discussion that conflict typically resides at the level of action perceived necessary to satisfy a higher-level condition (the requirements).

If you're able to define one side of the conflict but have trouble articulating the other, try "coming in through a back door." Start with the side of the conflict you prefer and ask yourself, "What stops me from doing my side?" The answer to this question can form the basis of the other side of the conflict.
