Most of us seek answers in the external world ([[External movement does not detach us from ourselves]]), but the right answers for you are already within, hiding in plain sight. Lean into the deep work required to understand your inner world. Introspect to find your desires, your values, your gifts. Untangle the emotional threads running through your life. This is how you find the raw material for creative work no one else but you could do.

It’s not you *and* the world, or you ‘versus’ the world. You are a part of the world, you ARE the world. This is the difference between seeing life as forces acting on you, and you BEING the force that acts upon the world. Former is limited, latter is unlimited. You are elemental.
