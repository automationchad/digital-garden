The nature of existence is that all phenomena are {impermanent}, {unsatisfactory}, and {not-self}.

See:

- [[Impermanence]]
- [[Unsatisfactoriness]]
- [[Not-self]]

This is a core doctrine of [[Buddhism]].

No, not better calibrated models! {Right now in your direct experience there is a sense of some sensations controlling other sensations}. This is the Anatta to investigate!”
