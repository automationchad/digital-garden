Racism serves as another potent weapon in the political arsenal, designed to divide communities and maintain control. By encouraging racial tension and animosity, those in power can distract from broader issues of social and economic inequality. The populace becomes too preoccupied with fighting among themselves to question the actions of their leaders or the systems in place. This engineered division also makes collective action difficult, as people are less likely to unite across racial lines to challenge authority. As long as the narrative remains focused on racial discord, the attention is diverted from the policies that perpetuate inequality and concentrate power among the elite. Racism, then, isn't just a social ill; it's a calculated political strategy.
