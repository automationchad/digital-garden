These are the sort of problems where people don’t even know that Zapier or software for their given problem exist.

Or businesses where teams are all functioning together and don’t really have communication silos (automobile repair shops, [Smith.ai](http://Smith.ai), retail merchandise stores, fast food restaurants).

They have nearly all the knowledge they need to make decisions that produce highly predictable outcomes.

You can merely point them in the right direction with little to no scoping of the problem.

There are best practices for solving the problem, and doing it a different way will be less effective.

BUT what Obvious companies should be careful is entrained thinking.

Entrained thinking sounds like this:

> “We got to the top by doing things _this_ way, why mess with success?”

When success breeds complacency ("best practice is, by definition, past practice"), there can be a catastrophic shift into the [Chaotic](https://www.notion.so/Chaotic-b619581fa760470aa639f706923fd17c?pvs=21) domain when the company is met with a new situation that it not covered by existing practices.

## How does Motis Group handle Obvious problems?

In a simple environment, you sense, categorize and respond.

You say, “Oh, it’s one of _those_ problems.”

No analysis is required.

**We as a consultancy want to avoid these types of problems because they're already likely solvable by someone internally at the company.**

This is why we ask questions in discovery like: [“_**Who’s done this before?**_”](https://www.notion.so/Who-s-done-this-before-f8a46fc65ae743f9b3f298c263b801b5?pvs=21)

But as much as we should avoid these **obvious** problems because our expertise may not provide much value, we should be cognisant of if those companies are getting complacent.

As they will likely fall into the trap of entrained thinking and be met with a shitty situation that they cannot solve with their existing resources.

What this looks like in practice: **Politely turning them away in our initial discovery call while keeping the door open for that emergency situation.**

> “Thanks for checking us out, here are some resources in the meantime. We’ll be here for any larger issues”

In these cases, it's often just a matter of time before they come back to us for help when the situation becomes dire.
