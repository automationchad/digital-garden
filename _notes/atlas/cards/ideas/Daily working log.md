Each day, I start a note titled with that day’s date; e.g. [2020-03-12](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z6sYEHb3jvjuTFHoiHpwixA). It captures ephemera throughout the day: reflections, scratch work, etc. It’s an intentional dumping ground, a release valve so that there’s always “a place to put that thing.”

In the [[Taxonomy of note types]] this is the lowest-fidelity layer, ephemeral by design. But as scratch thoughts look like they might have legs, they get extracted into a note in my writing inbox ([[A writing inbox for transient and incomplete notes]]). Sometimes I’ll use the daily working log as a drafting space, and I can extract sections roughly-as-is into [[Evergreen notes]].

For me, the important bits are:

1. This is a space where I can put anything and feel zero friction. ([[Close open loops]])
2. I feel a natural pressure to extract anything which wants to “outlive the day”—to move up the [[Taxonomy of note types]].

Because the daily working log is also a live note, it also functions as a useful stub for [[Contextual backlinks]]: [[Backlinks can be used to implicitly define nodes in knowledge management systems]].
