The concept of non-coercion serves as the foundation upon which I want to design my life. It's the guiding principle that keeps me on track.

So, what's coercion all about? 

> Coercion involves compelling a party to act in an involuntary manner by the use of threats, including threats to use force against that party. It involves a set of forceful actions which violate the *free will* of an individual in order to induce a desired response.

In my worldview, coercion extends beyond mere threats and force. It encapsulates any situation where you're tethered to an external entity—whether that's a person, a corporation, or a government—that provides the rulebook for how you should live and act. You're not just reacting to threats; you're being subtly moulded by expectations, norms, or economic necessities.

Following the principles of [[Levels of magnification]] I see this playing out 3 ways:

1. *Intellectually*: This is about sharpening your thinking to ensure you're making decisions from a place of autonomy ([[Do your own thinking]]), not conforming to societal norms or external pressures.
   
2. *Peer-to-peer*: At this level, it's about forming relationships based on mutual respect and freedom, avoiding manipulative tactics and power plays ([[Non-coercive marketing; Anti-marketing]], [[Operate from the inside-out]]). This also means not just doing work that pays the bills, but engaging in endeavors that are intrinsically rewarding ([[Non-coercive productivity]]).
   
3. *Institutionally*: Here, you're navigating the systems of governance and societal structures in a way that minimizes coercion and maximizes personal freedom. You put yourself in environments [[Go where you're treated best|where you're treated best]])
