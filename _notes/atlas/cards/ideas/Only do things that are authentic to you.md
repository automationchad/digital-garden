When you go out in downtown the level of thinking required to have a simple meal massively outweighs the actual meal.

You have to drive thereâ€¦

Worry about parkingâ€¦

Get there on time because it's busyâ€¦

Line up to get inâ€¦

Pay to get inâ€¦

Line up for drinksâ€¦

Pay for drinksâ€¦

Worry about an increased crime levelâ€¦

â€¦and deal with drunk people acting stupid.

The juice is not worth the squeeze.

Instead, I enjoy being able to show up to a place when I want and not have any obligation of being there other than wanting to be there.

I don't have to get to Piatti at 7 pm sharp because there's a line or they have a special deal to get in.

I go there at any given time because it's a consistently nice experience that has a very low emotional investment.

Consequently, the emotional result is so much more enjoyable because I haven't wasted half my energy stressing about getting there.

When adding new options to my life, I try to integrate them into my existing daily routine.

For example, I prefer ocean swimming to using a cold plunge tub because it takes less time to set up and provides the same benefits.

By doing this, I avoid diverting too much from my path and avoid resistance.
