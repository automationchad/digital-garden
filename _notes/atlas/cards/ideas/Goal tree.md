> _**It is more important to know where you‚Äôre going that to get there quickly. Do not mistake activity for accomplishment**_ ‚Äî Mabel Newcomber

The Goal Tree is a navigation marker or benchmark. It provides the fixed point of reference for ********all******** other tools. In every phase of operations it lets us feel comfortable with the answers to these questions:

- Are we on course toward our goal?
- Are we doing the things we *should* be doing to get there? If not, what‚Äôs missing?
- Are we doing things that don‚Äôt contribute to the early attainment of our goal? If so, what should we stop doing?
- How do we know when we‚Äôve achieved our goal?

>üö® Key distinction: The Goal Tree provides reassurance that we‚Äôre doing the *right* things but NOT necessarily doing things *right*.

Success is the achievement of the purpose for which the system was designed.

What many people fail to realise is that mission accomplishment and ultimate system success aren‚Äôt stand-alone things. They exist in a hierarchy of dependent actions and achievements that are not always intuitively obvious. In order to be successful, a system must accomplish its mission, realise its vision of the future, and in doing so adhere to its stated values. 

Even if we have an ultimate purpose ‚Äî a mission ‚Äî and a vision of what we want our future to look like, we lack a way to connect the day-to-day efforts and activities of the system to these higher-level aspirations.

Absent that clear connection, we risk replicating the experience of the Roman Emperor Nero: fiddling while Rome burns.

Too much of our attention is devoted to things that don't matter... things that consume valuable resources (time, money, and skill) yet don't contribute in any meaningful way to fulfilling the system's mission.

The Goal Tree is the the lower part of strategic system hierarchy.

### Mission 

`Def:` A high level purpose which survives indefinitely as long as the system exists.
 
### Goal

`Def:` A long-term measurable outcome that, when achieved, clearly denotes mission accomplishment.

Q: How does [[#Mission]] and [[#Goal]] relate to each other?

Consider goal attainment to be a visible indicator of mission accomplishment.

The Goal Tree is a means of fulfilling two of the most important needs of systems leaders:

1. Visualising vertical linkage‚Äîhow the action ‚Äúwhere the rubber meets the road‚Äù contributes to the achievement of the system‚Äôs goal and mission.

2. Determining what activity is really necessary for system success and what isn‚Äôt.

In order to be successful, a system must accomplish it‚Äôs mission, realize it‚Äôs vision of the future and in doing so adhere to it‚Äôs stated values.

A good Goal Tree allows every member of the organisation to see where their efforts fit into the bigger picture. When people see this vertical inkage, they understand their own importance to the systems success.
