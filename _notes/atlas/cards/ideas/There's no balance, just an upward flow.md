In the grand theater of existence, the primary act is the ceaseless flow of energy. Digestion, assimilation, conversion—these aren't mere biological terms; they are the keys to understanding a broad spectrum of phenomena we often mistake as separate entities: discipline, consistency, time, money, learning, and so forth. Strip away the illusions, and you're left with the elemental: metabolic functions driving the course of your life.

Why are we drawn to the sun, or to the sweetness of sugar, or the allure of novelty and youth? It's not whimsical; it's a deep-rooted pull toward sources of energy. Similarly, success isn't an abstract reward for doing what we ought; it's the natural outcome of investing ourselves in pursuits that genuinely resonate with our energetic makeup. Physical digestion, mental digestion—they're not disparate processes but different facets of the same essential transfer and transformation of energy.

Life shouldn't be a struggle; that's a misinterpretation. No need for force, for reasoning, or even for discipline. These are constructs, artifacts of a mindset divorced from the natural order. Your intuition, your senses, your gut feelings—these are not just psychological tools but your direct line to a higher, divine flow of energy.

This isn't about abstaining from physical pleasure; it's about recognizing the essence of what really matters. And in this state of understanding, you should find yourself not just content but overflowing, always. The act of living becomes a continuous process of absorbing, digesting, and assimilating.

At its core, life is a metabolic process. And if one were to seek its ultimate expression, one might say: God embodies this process at its most sublime.
