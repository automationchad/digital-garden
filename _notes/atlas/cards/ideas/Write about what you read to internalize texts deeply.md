If you want to deeply internalize something you’re reading, the best way I know is to write about it:

- because [[Understanding requires effortful engagement]]
    - and in particular, [[Writing forces sharper understanding]]
    - remember: [[Collecting material feels more useful than it usually is]]
- because otherwise you won’t [[Do your own thinking]]
- because [[Knowledge work should accrete]] and [[Evergreen note-writing helps reading efforts accumulate]]
- indeed: [[Most people read ineffectively]]

For deep understanding, it’s not enough to just highlight or write marginalia in books: there isn’t much pressure to synthesize, connect, or to get to the heart of things. And they don’t add up to anything over time as you read more. Instead, write [[Evergreen notes]] as you read.

But of course, it doesn’t always make sense to read in this way: much of the time you’re not really trying to internalize the text deeply, and text may not be worthy of that much attention: [[The best way to read is highly contextual]].

Also, it’s worth noting: [[The most effective readers and thinkers I know don’t take notes when reading]]. Speaking at least for myself, experience has suggested that I need more support to effectively engage with what I’m reading.

## Method

Our broad approach is an alternating cycle:

1. **Collect** passages that seem interesting and thoughts that emerge while reading: [[How to collect observations while reading]]
2. **Process** clusters of those passages and thoughts into lasting notes: [[How to process reading annotations into evergreen notes]]
