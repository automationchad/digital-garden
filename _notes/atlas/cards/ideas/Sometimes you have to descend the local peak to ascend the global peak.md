<aside> ðŸ’¡ Vastly underrated predictor of success: willingness to be low-status.

</aside>

Everyone drones on about stuff like hard work, but so many of the top people I've met were uniquely willing to spend years looking like they're working on something silly or insignificant.

I would argue this is a side effect of a more fundamental character trait:

**Knowing very clearly and to a high degree of confidence what it is they want to do with their time/resources, independent of the in-vogue pursuit of the voices around them.**

To have high goals and be very ambitious but willing to mop floors and scrub toilets. Highly underrated character traits.

> You often have to descend the local peak for any hope at all at ascending toward what may be the global peak. People seem bad at this, unless they start early and develop a taste for it.

Cultivate the requisite humility and status masochism while you still can.

When you get into sales thereâ€™s 2 different types of offers you can get on.

1. You can join a newer company that has little infrastructure or;
2. An established company where everything is already set in place and you can just come in, make calls and get paid.

To determine what route you should go you need to figure out your long term goals then reverse engineer.

Are you in sales to be the best salesman and stack cash? The established offer is probably better suited for you.

Are you in sales to learn a skill and be able to see how a business is ran so you can start your own one day? The first option is probably best.

I knew when I got into sales it was just a stepping stone. So I worked with a lot of newer/startup companies. Oftentimes one of the only if not the only sales reps.

Doing this made me lose out on A LOT of money. But the experience I gained in understanding how to build the infrastructure for a business was incredibly valuable.

Iâ€™ve been able to come into a company and completely build out their systems, SOPs, interview, hire, train, manage sales reps because I knew I didnâ€™t want to be a closer forever. I had bigger goals in mind.

Figure out what you want and work backwards.
