> The real growth in the adoption of e-books will happen when the traditional book is deconstructed and reconstructed (textually, behaviorally and commercially) in order to create new paradigms for storing and delivering content in electronic forms. [Carden, 2008](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zDGk8tvVDD1mbTgpMMB5UGh?stackedNotes=zPVYHEJdDBoMoQV5pQ4h71S&stackedNotes=zMHusNNzg8DveY5HJFbh1RU&stackedNotes=z2bSwDuxY2Jbv1ntLKB3SL1)

- [[Continuous-scroll digital reading uncomfortably disrupts object permanence]]
- [[Poor performance disrupts nonlinear reading in digital reading]]
- [[Maintaining multiple reading positions is difficult when reading digitally]]
- [[Parallel reading is mostly impossible in digital reading]]
- [[Few digital reading environments support marginal notes]]
- [[Digital annotation is too formal]]
- [[Backlit displays limit computers to interiors]]

This is an important problem because [[Mass adoption of written media with novel cognitive supports requires mass adoption of reading on computers]] (or else we need [[Methods for bringing dynamic mediums to physical reading contexts]]).

- [[Deep focus comes more easily for me when developing ideas in a paper notebook, rather than with a computer]]
