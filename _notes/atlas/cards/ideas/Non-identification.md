See also [[Not-self]]. It is possible to notice an impulse, thought, desire, aversion, concern, etc, without _identifying with_ that sensation. That is: the relationship can become “I sense a feeling of impatience” (akin to hearing a sound from the street outside), rather than “I’m impatient” or even “I can’t believe this is taking so long” ([[Everything takes longer than you think it will]]). This practice is not about _ignoring_ impulses—you still sense them and can choose to act on them—but rather about making them an object rather than a subject, removing them from the driver’s seat, etc.

This is a practice I learned from [[Buddhism]], though I imagine it’s a part of many contemplative traditions.

Q. @vgr riffing on Kegan for career and identity: “I am my title -> I am my job, I have a title -> I am my work, I have a job with a title -> I am what I do, I have work to do in a job with a title? 
A. “I am, I have doings.”
