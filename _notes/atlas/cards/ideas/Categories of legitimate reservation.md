1. **Clarity**: Making sure everything is understood clearly.
2. **Entity Existence**: Checking if the things being talked about actually exist.
3. **Causality Existence**: Checking if the cause really leads to the effect.
4. **Cause Sufficiency**: Checking if the cause is enough to create the effect.
5. **Additional Cause**: Checking if there are other causes that could create the same effect.
6. **Cause-Effect Reversal**: Making sure the cause and effect are not confused.
7. **Predicted Effect Existence**: Checking for additional effects that could confirm the cause.
8. **Tautology**: Avoiding circular logic, where the effect is used to prove the cause.

# Clarity

_**********************Seeking to understand**********************_

Validity of logic is not addressed until _********************mutual understanding********************_ is achieved.

Examples of breakdown in communication:

- The listener doesn‚Äôt understand the _**meaning**_ of the speaker‚Äôs statement
- The listener doesn't see the _significance_ of the speaker's statement.
- The listener doesn't understand the _meaning_ or _context_ of specific words or phrases in the speaker's statement.
- The listener doesn't recognize a reasonable connection between a stated cause and a stated effect.
- The listener doesn‚Äôt see some intermediate steps implied by the speaker but not explicitly stated. (In cause-effect trees, this is sometimes referred to as a ‚Äúlong arrow.‚Äù)
- Would I add any verbal explanation if reading the tree to someone else?
- Is the meaning/context of words unambiguous?
- Is the connection between cause and effect convincing "at face value"?
- Are intermediate steps missing?

# Entity Existence

_**Complete, properly structured, valid statements of cause or effect**_

- Is it a complete sentence?
- Does it make sense?
- Is it free of embedded ‚Äúif-then‚Äù statements? (Look for ‚Äú‚Ä¶because‚Ä¶‚Äù and ‚Äú‚Ä¶in order to‚Ä¶.‚Äù)
- Does it convey only one idea? (not a compound entity)
- Does it exist in my (or someone‚Äôs) reality?
- Can it be documented with evidence?

# Causality existence

_**Logical connection between cause and effect**_

- Does an "if-then" connection really exist?
- Does the proposed cause, in fact, result in the stated effect?
- Does it make sense when read aloud exactly as written?
- Is the cause intangible? (If so, look for a confirming additional predicted effect)

# Cause insufficiency

_**A non-trivial dependent element missing**_

- Can the cause, as stated, result in the effect on its own?
- Are any significant causal factors missing?
- Are the written cause(s) sufficient to justify all parts of the effect(s)?
- Is an ellipsis required?
- Are any causes that are not really dependent included?

# Additional cause

_**A separate, independent cause producing the same effect**_

- Is there anything else that might cause the same effect on its own?
- If the stated cause is eliminated, will the effect be (almost completely) eliminated?

# Cause-effect reversal

_**Effect misstated as the cause; arrow pointing in the wrong direction.**_

- Is the stated effect really the cause, and the stated effect really the effect?
- Is the stated cause really a reason why, or just how we know the effect exists?

# Predicted effect existence

***Additional corroborating effect resulting from the cause***

To determine whether a predicted effect supports or refutes a cause-effect relationship, test it with the following proofs:

|                                                 | Support | Refute |
|-------------------------------------------------|---------|--------|
| The effect is there, but shouldn‚Äôt be.          |         | X      |
| The effect is not there, but should be.         |         | X      |
| The effect is there, and should be.             | X       |        |
| The effect can coexist with the predicted effect| X       |        |
| The predicted and proposed effects are mutually exclusive. |  | X  |
| The predicted effect is more or less than expected. |       | X    |
| The predicted effect is about the same degree as expected. | X |   |


To avoid confusion, verbalize a predicted effect existence reservation this way:

> üö® ‚ÄúIf we accept that [CAUSE] is the reason for [ORIGINAL EFFECT], then it must also lead to [PREDICTED EFFECT(S)], which [do/do not] exist.‚Äù

- Is the cause intangible?
- Do other unavoidable outcomes of the proposed cause exist besides the stated effect?

# Tautology

_**Circular logic**_

- Is the cause intangible?
- Is the effect offered as the rationale for the existence of the cause? (for example, "What else could it be?")
- Are other unavoidable outcomes identifiable besides the proposed effect?
