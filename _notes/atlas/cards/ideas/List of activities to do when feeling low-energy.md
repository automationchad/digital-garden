- Nap
- Lift weights
- Go on a long walk
- Read good words: books in my inbox; read Pocket. Doesn’t have to be “serious academic” stuff, but if I’m feeling it, read papers
- Watch “good video”: great films, great talks. I should assemble a list for easy access
- Write to friends
- Visit SFMOMA
- Meditate (perhaps walking meditation?)
- Play piano (enjoyable stuff—doesn’t have to be “practice”… just _play!_)
