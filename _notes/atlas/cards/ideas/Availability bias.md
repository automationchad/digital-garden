People who leave reviews are either ranting fans or hate the restaurant. We don't see the countless others who loved the food but never left a review. But they create an ecosystem where the silent majority's preferences are often drowned out by a vocal minority.

**Silent Majority**: The vast majority might be content but not vocal. This is the status quo, and there's no urgency to speak out. However, their silence allows outliers to dominate the narrative. This is why it's so hard to break out of the majority, because the rich are the minority, they create the narrative. Opinions are largely then maintained by the majority.

**Social Proof**: People look for cues from others on how to behave or think. The opinions of a vocal minority can serve as a de facto standard, skewing the perception of quality or value for a restaurant, for instance.

**Negativity Bias**: Negative experiences often compel people to share more than positive experiences. A bad meal could lead to a scathing review, whereas a great meal might not elicit the same urgency to review. This creates a skewed public image.

**The Matthew Effect**: Those who gain a little advantage (positive reviews, in this case) will continue to gain more, while those with initial disadvantages (negative reviews) will find it difficult to recover.
