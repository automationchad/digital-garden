(Not sure if this note will/can be evergreen… so consider this some initial thinking as of [2022-06-06](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zVyhgX3Sx8UEjugYYyCTKnR))

It’s funny… when I was a kid, my computer was my place, the happy place, a place I’d escape to. Now I find myself not wanting to look at a computer at all outside of my morning working block. Which is sort of bad, since I want to e.g. read in the afternoon on it.

- It feels like it’s buzzing with distracting energy, like trying to do something hard on a noisy, crowded train.
    - Disabling WiFi helps, but it’s not enough… there’s still plenty on my computer to fiddle with!
    - Twitter is always just a few keystrokes away.
    - Worse, I notice myself needing validation on it. There’s this impulse to get social approval, particularly after I’ve just written something. I want to care less what other people—particularly random Twitter people—think.
    - Plan for contending with this: log out of Twitter in Safari; habituate myself to using TweetDeck and de-metricator’d Twitter in FireFox.
    - Mail is always just a few keystrokes away
    - Calm it down by only showing unread
    - Use Focus to make it unavailable most of the day
- It’s a place I associate with obligation…
    - …in part because I’ve centralized so much activity onto it in the name of efficiency:
    - Text messages and emails waiting to be answered
    - Tabs to be processed
    - Notes to be written
    - And so when I sit down to do thing X, I feel distracted by the possibility of handling all these other obligations.
    - Also because it’s where I do my work! So at any time, when I’m using it, I _could_ be doing work! There’s always more work to do.
    - And because I’ve been really locking down my computer habits while I do work, I’ve trained myself that using the computer without some productive intention is bad.
        - This isn’t necessarily bad—I don’t want to sit down at it thoughtlessly—but it does create a certain burden.
- It’s a place I associate with struggle
    - The work I do is hard!
    - Writing good notes and prompts about books is hard! So much easier to just read on the [reMarkable](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zY3ztn1J5d9EJ1zDD9UZC36) without any extra work.
- It’s a place I associate with danger
    - Because distraction and senselessness are so easy, I’ve trained myself that the computer is a dangerous place to be!
    - Like I always have to be on my guard!
    - Which… is sort of true. But it’s costly. Ideally I could arrange the computer so that I didn’t always have to be on my guard.
