==TODO: flesh this out; write a note for each note type; etc==

For me, the practice of writing and revising notes is, at its core, about trying to move up the following rough ladder:

- Ephemeral scratchings in [[Daily working log]]
  
- Prompts and incomplete notes in writing inbox ([[A writing inbox for transient and incomplete notes]]), which are meant to possibly become [[Evergreen notes]]. These prompts may accumulate writing over time via spaced repetition (see [Spaced repetition may be a helpful tool to incrementally develop inklings](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zSK4LyrCbG9zDrdCWmcovUW))
  
- [[Evergreen notes]] in increasingly complex stages of development:
  
	- stubs implicitly defined through backlinks ([[Backlinks can be used to implicitly define nodes in knowledge management systems]]); e.g. [[Note-writing system]], [[Audiobooks]]
	  
	- simple definitions for terms of art, little of my own added; e.g. [Span of absolute judgment](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zMQK1sFXWbVMbSQAsjSTUvm), [Spacing effect](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4KScVkQCD2XmVwvSDUbZtn)
      
    - [[Bridge notes narrowly relate two adjacent terms]]
      
    - precise, narrow declarative notes ([[Prefer note titles with complete phrases to sharpen claims]]); e.g. [[Human channel capacity increases with stimulus dimensionality]]
      
    - sometimes these are framed as questions, when evidence is too inconclusive to frame sharply; e.g. [[To what extent is exceptional ability heritable?]], [To what extent can application prompts supplant recall prompts in the mnemonic medium?](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zMPNEnSC5ihp5MNMdxNJNdJ)
      
    - higher-level APIs / patterns ([[Patterns are what life is about]], [[Evergreen note titles are like APIs]])
      
    - notes abstracting over many other notes, e.g. [[Educational games are a doomed approach to creating enabling environments]], [[Reading texts on computers is unpleasant]]
      
    - personal terms of art, e.g. [[Enacted experience]]

- “Outline notes”, e.g. [[§Enabling environments, games, and the Primer]]

Note types outside this ladder:

- Proper noun notes
    - “Literature notes”, titled after a single work and meant primarily as linkages to other more durable notes, and as targets for backlinks. I write these roughly as “outline notes,” except for someone else’s ideas. For example: [[Miller - The magical number seven, plus or minus two]]
    - Likewise, but less commonly, I also have “person notes” (e.g. [Anand Agarawala](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zLXY8Ru3EzeKyjhqoYgCJD7)) and “business notes” (e.g. [Confluent](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zQ2vjssuHu3869yDHpTmYbm))
    - These note types are weakly evergreen. I may add to them over time, but because they aren’t concept-oriented ([[Evergreen notes should be concept-oriented]])), they’re not as useful to build on as an evergreen note. Non-trivial writing about proper nouns typically gets factored into separate evergreen notes which can be used in multiple places.
    - “Log” notes, which accumulate ephemeral observations about a specific practice, system, or project over time. They’re akin to a [[Daily working log]], but sliced by some topic of interest rather than by date. e.g. [Log: personal mnemonic medium](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zDuBTrCGDkf2J2TbtQwKDed)
    - With better transclusion or support for [[Contextual backlinks]], such notes could be written directly in one’s [[Daily working log]], and “log” notes could be defined as a query over such notes.

Tactically speaking, I usually denote a note’s “type” with a tag.

Don’t over-obsess or over-formalize this stuff. Remember: [[“Better note-taking” misses the point; what matters is “better thinking”]].
