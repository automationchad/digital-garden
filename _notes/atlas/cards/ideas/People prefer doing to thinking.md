The phrase comes from a paper from Timothy Wilson and colleagues, describing a variety of studies in which participants were asked to sit and think in a bare room for 15 minutes. In one of the studies, the room contained a device they could use to shock themselves, and almost half did—even though they previously answered that they’d pay to avoid a shock!

A. Wilson et al asked people to sit and think for 15 minutes but offered them a device they could use to shock themselves, and many did, despite previously stating that they’d pay money to avoid a shock!
