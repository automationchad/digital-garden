Many bloggers and “life-hackers” have made a full-time job of suggesting how you should organize your journal, or how you should most effectively [Write about what you read to internalize texts deeply](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zB74H9CuWrosEuqve7jZyCo). We should take this advice seriously insofar as those practices have helped the authors achieve meaningful creative work: [“Better note-taking” misses the point; what matters is “better thinking”](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zAf4oNSV9qB38ncSvYEZGAb)

But most people who write about note-taking don’t seem particularly accomplished in their own fields, whatever those may be. In fact, most such writers aren’t applying their notes to some exogenous creative problem: their primary creative work _is_ writing about productivity. These writers offer advice on note-taking to help scientists and executives with the challenges of their work, but the advice was developed in a context disconnected from those external realities. There are two related problems here: [[Effective system design requires insights drawn from serious contexts of use]], and [Powerful enabling environments usually arise as a byproduct of projects pursuing their own intrinsically meaningful purposes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z2huUCj3ko99HdzFcmEDfZD).

Luhmann, by contrast, barely wrote about his [[Zettelkasten]] he focused on his prolific research output, then published a couple small essays about his practices near the end of his career.

I’m not quite guilty of this problem myself, but I certainly slip into this behavior for weeks at a time. This is a cautionary note. Related: [The most effective readers and thinkers I know don’t take notes when reading](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z12PGwFx275xTmGHazNgQbn).
