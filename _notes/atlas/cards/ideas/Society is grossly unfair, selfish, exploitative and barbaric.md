Denial isn't just a river; it's a pervasive mindset that allows systemic injustice to fester. Consider this: most people don't think they're part of the problem because they're not overtly causing harm. But that's a smokescreen. The issue isn't just personal actions; it's the collective systems we live in and perpetuate. Take the wage-slave phenomenon. Employers often absolve themselves with the rationale that 'this is just how capitalism works.' They're not wrong, but they're not right either. The system itself is engineered to benefit a select few while leaving others economically oppressed.

Even when you flip the script and look at the oppressed, the story gets complicated. Many don't recognize their own oppression because society has conditioned them to believe it's normal. Take the example of women in certain religious communities who accept restrictive dress codes as a form of piety rather than oppression. This is internalized injustice, masquerading as cultural or religious norms.

The rich-poor gap isn't just about numbers; it's about lost potential. The system deprives billions of the opportunity to self-actualize, to become the teachers, artists, or inventors they could be. This isn't just their loss; it's society's loss. The system's skewed distribution of resources doesn't just create economic disparity; it stunts collective human potential.

Here's the kicker: attempts to rectify systemic oppression often make the oppressors feel oppressed. Imagine a slave owner being told slavery is immoral. His immediate response might be defensive, framing himself as the victim. 'How dare you take away my slaves?' This is the devilry of systemic oppression. Those benefiting from it will craft narratives to justify its continuation.

Selfishness might work in the short term, but it's a ticking time bomb. When imbalance becomes too glaring, the system will correct itself, often through violent meansâ€”protests, civil disobedience, revolutions. These uprisings are less about anarchy and more about restoring balance to a system that has tilted too far in favor of the privileged.

The purpose of government should be to mitigate these inequalities. If it's not doing that, it's not just flawed; it's corrupt and warrants immediate reform. The point is, denial is an unsustainable strategy. Sooner or later, the system will demand its pound of flesh, and no amount of rationalization can stop the reckoning that follows.
