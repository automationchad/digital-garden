You can survey the terrain and de-risk as much as is sensible, but you’ll reach your destination via the insights and opportunities you discover along the way. You have to [[Operating with a compass not a map]]. Consequently, it’s terribly important that you keep your eyes open and avoid fooling yourself: your breakthrough might be hiding in that outlier data point you’re tempted to elide in your analysis.
