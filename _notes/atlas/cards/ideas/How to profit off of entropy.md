> You cannot exchange something fake for something fake and expect the satisfactions of creating something real

The dance of commerce, as we have constructed it, is often a shadow play, a realm of illusions.

We trade the ephemeral for the ephemeral, debt for titles, paper for paper, and imagine ourselves wealthy. [[If you win the rat race, you're still a rat]]

But such transactions, no matter how complex or lucrative they may seem, can never provide the deep satisfaction that comes from creating something tangible and real.

They will always be a zero sum game.

One person wins at anotherâ€™s expense.

No tangible value being created.

A business, a product, a service -- these are not abstract concepts but concrete realities.

They have form and substance.

They serve a purpose, fulfill a need, improve a life.

When an entrepreneur opens a business, they bring into existence something that was not there before, something that is intrinsically valuable, something real.

Making businesses more efficient through automation or creating robotic prosthetics.

Growing Heirloom oils and foods or [[Creating authentic life experiences for travellers]].

This creation, this act of making, has a satisfaction that no financial transaction can match.

It is the satisfaction of the artist who steps back from the canvas to see a scene come to life, or the craftsman who feels the smooth finish of a piece of wood transformed by skill and effort.

So, while the world may tempt us with the allure of quick riches and easy gains through abstractions like crypto, stocks, bonds (claims on resources), do not forget that these things are bread and circuses, they do not represent true value.

The creation of something tangible, something real, is a far more rewarding pursuit than the acquisition of ephemeral assets.

Because in the end, it is the real that endures, the real that satisfies, the real that truly matters.

But with these claims on wealth that help others get so rich, and the Egoâ€™s general laziness towards any hard work, another seductive dream, another siren call to those who seek wealth without effort, casts itâ€™s spell over young and lost men: passive income.

But it is a myth, a mirage in the desert of financial reality.

So then ultimately, why is this so?

Why doesn't passive income work?

Well, why doesn't passive fitness exist?

The answer lies in the fundamental nature of the universe: entropy.

Entropy is the tendency for systems to move towards disorder and chaos.

It is a force of nature, a universal law.

When left alone, things get worse, not better.

They become more chaotic, not more organized.

They get more shit, to use our terms.

To counteract entropy, to create order out of chaos, to build and growâ€¦

â€¦Requires work.

It requires action.

This is the true nature of income.

It is not something that comes passively, but something that is earned through active effort.

So, if you think that passiveness plus entropy equals order and growth, you are indeed deluded.

It is a mathematical impossibility, a violation of the laws of the universe.

The equation for success, for real wealth, is not passiveness plus entropy, but activity minus entropy.

The real world is an active world.

It is a world of work, of effort, of engagement.

It is being an active participant in the world, not a passive observer.

Consider the story of the Italian hotel owner Mario.

He is not a billionaire.

He does not sit in a mansion playing XBOX.

Or sit on a yacht all day sipping Mimosas with his 3 escort girlfriends.

And he does not hoover up wealth from others.

Yet he is wealthy in the truest sense of the word.

His wealth is not measured in dollars or euros, but in relationships, in satisfaction, in the joy of creation.

He is active, hands-on, involved.

His is not passive income, but active value creation.

This is the true path to wealth, to satisfaction, to a life well-lived.
