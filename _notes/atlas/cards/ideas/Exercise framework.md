All movement are joints expanding, or compressing. Understand that any extending or flexing at any joint will have internal or external rotation components as it's expand or compress. Everything is rotational

On top of that, Stretching is Lifting, Lifting is Stretching. Add Load to Stretches, Add Full Range of Motion to Lifts and to minimize time spent, we do them together.

First set = always a Loaded Stretch for time. Weighted Isometric Holds expanding maximum range of motion.

Then do 2-3 sets of 5-12 with slow controlled eccentric, explosive fast concentric.

Progressively overloading based on REPS. Ex: Back Squat of 225. Hit 3 working sets of 8.

If you can get more than 8 reps (always go for as many as possible last set) then you add 5 lbs next week

Make sure you are feeling the muscle(s) you want to work in your minds eye and utilize max tension

Any split CAN work, but I think the best split is a 4 day/week upper/lower split. Gives 2 days between using a specific muscle group for recovery but still an aggressive workload.

Take Wednesday, Saturday, Sunday off from lifting

Can obviously add stuff to some of these days, but this is essentialist structure that will give you all you need with minimal & effective time planning that you can use forever & works every joint .

Monday

- Knees - a squat variation, hamstring work (prone leg curls, exercise ball curls)
- Ankles - calf raises, core - spinal flexion (Jefferson curls), spinal extension (reverse hypers/back extensions),
- Ab work (decline crunches/hanging leg raises).

Tuesday

- Mouth - jaw/tongue exercises & breath work
- Neck - flexion / extension / rotation work
- Shoulders - vertical pressing (overhead press variation) / pulling (lat pulldown/pull up variation), accessory movements (3 way delts, external rotation work, face pulls, trap 3 raises)

Thurs

- Hips - hinges (RDL/good morning, prone work (Superman's/pigeon holds), adduct (cable pancake), abduct (horse stance squats), hip extension (hip thrusts)
- Rotation/Gait - lunge patterning, any sort of throwing work,
- Feet - working on arches, toe curls, toe up heel up holds

Friday

- Chest / Back - horizontal pressing (any bench press variation) / pulling (any row variation)
- Elbows - bicep (curls) / tricep (tricep pushdowns/ kickbacks) work
- Traps/Grip - thick bar holds, squeeze grip and extend grip, shrugs or farmer carries

Activity: 10k steps per day MINIMUM.

TREADMILL:

- 12.5-15% incline
- 3.0-3.5mph
- NO HOLDING ONTO TREADMILL
- 60+ minutes if you’re a G

Sprint/Jump (when you’re sprinting or jumping optimize for VELOCITY, not work. Only do max effort/max recovery stuff. Endurance work you get with the next two),

Play a Sport you Enjoy or Hit some form of cardio.

3-4x times per week.

The higher your athletic aspirations, the more you probably need to work on the first two vs just doing cardiovascular/endurance activity, but that stuff doesn’t hurt unless you’re crazy overdoing it.
