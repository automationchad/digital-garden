When writing [[Evergreen notes]], it’s tempting to write notes like “X is bad” or “Y doesn’t work.” Prefer instead to write note titles which express the property or requirement in a positive sense.

If you’ve thought them through, negatively-oriented notes usually contain a descriptive theory of why the missing/flawed property is important. By bringing that theory to the foreground, you make it easier to see the claims in a systematic context, which, in turn, makes it easier to build on.

For example:

- [Metacognitive supports require dynamic, participatory environments](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zADYGiM6rnN6iTBHqVa6kiu), not “Passive environments can’t offer good metacognitive support”
- [[Use phones to collect and triage, not (usually) to read]], not “Don’t read on your phone”
