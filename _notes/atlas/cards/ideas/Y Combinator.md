Y Combinator is a startup incubator which, besides funding, offers its participants a structured environment meant to accelerate both their company and their personal capacity. Many of the activities focus on conveying a honed set of practices and values: e.g. interviews and dinners with successful past founders transmit cultural knowledge almost mythically; a canonical set of books and talks do likewise; the tight Demo Day timeline mandates a certain way of doing; office hours provide direct coaching in the same principles.

Y Combinator is an [[Enabling environment]]: founders regularly report finding themselves suddenly able to do much more—and not just because of the funds. It’s like a school in some shallow sense, but the key difference is that all of a founder’s activities revolve around building the startup they’re ridiculously passionate about—not around learning some abstract set of skills which are meant to enable something intrinsically meaningful later ([[Enabling environments’ activities directly serve an intrinsically meaningful purpose]]).

Y Combinator is also an [[Enacted experience]]. By structuring their lives around the dinners, milestones, talks, and office hours, founders fairly consistently absorb a certain set of practices and values, and at events like Demo Day, they fairly consistently experience a certain set of emotional experiences. But many of these experiences don’t feel “forced” from the outside; many of the experiences feel like something the founders brought about—even though they wouldn’t have been accessible outside the context of YC ([[Enacted experiences can bootstrap active participation in enabling environments]]). These activities aren’t framed as “practice.” They’re framed as _doing_ ([Enabling environments focus on creating opportunities for growth and action, not on skill-building](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z7d63BYfJrd81VFE25jkcDd)).

Y Combinator also offers “Startup School,” a pared-down distance learning version of the same program. My impression is that it doesn’t offer the same consistency in enacted experience—but it would be very powerful if it did (see [Enacted experiences have incredible potential as a mass medium](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z984ZZLbG4wREM6HAZAovMB)).
