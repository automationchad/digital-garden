In response to [[People seem to forget most of what they read, and they mostly don’t notice]], many suggest that they don’t _want_ detailed recall. They do most of their reading “to get a general picture,” or “just to get a conceptual understanding.” That might sometimes be possible, but in many cases it’s not possible to really understand a concept without a firm grasp of the details on which it’s built.

The intuitive argument:

> Bluntly, it seems likely that such people are fooling themselves, confusing a sense of enjoyment with any sort of durable understanding. Imagine meeting a person who told you they “had a broad conceptual understanding” of how to speak French, but it turned out they didn’t know the meaning of “bonjour”, “au revoir”, or “tres bien”. You’d think their claim to have a broad conceptual understanding of French was hilarious.”

A more concrete argument is that conceptual understanding is mostly about connections—understanding how elements relate to each other, causes, effects, implications, constraints, tendencies, etc. You can’t understand these high-order relationships without familiarity with their constituents.

Another argument draws on our understanding of human information processing: [Expertise requires building sophisticated chunk recoding schemes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zK3Qi3FKpVtNp5Ss47d8136).

Q. Reductio ad absurdum argument against someone who only wants a “broad conceptual understanding,” not detailed recall?  
A. That’s like wanting to have a “broad conceptual understanding” of French without knowing the meaning of “bonjour.”

Q. Connectivist argument that deep understanding requires detailed knowledge of fundamentals?  
A. Conceptual understanding is largely about relationships; can’t learn the edges without knowing the nodes.
