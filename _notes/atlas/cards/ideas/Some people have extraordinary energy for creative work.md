    - George Church
    - many key discoveries, founded many companies, many side projects
    - worked 100 hour weeks in the lab during grad school
    - forgets to eat for days if no one reminds him
    - Lee Hood
    - kept 18 hour workdays, starting each with running a few miles and doing 100 push-ups
    - did scientific reading until 11PM or midnight, then slept 4-6 hours
    - Napoleon

But I didn’t get any work done. I’d get up in the morning and stare at a blank piece of paper. I’d have no ideas, just like an ordinary person. You’ve set mathematics back a month.”
