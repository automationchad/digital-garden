Politics and government are often viewed as abstract, bureaucratic systems. But at their core, they're deeply entwined with survival—both individual and collective. Your very identity, whether personal or as part of a larger group, is inextricably linked to political dynamics. It's not just about left or right; identity politics is the water we're all swimming in.

**The Blind Spots of Low Consciousness**

A lack of awareness, especially about one's own biases and selfish motives, can have rippling effects. Consider the United States: the nation often operates without full consciousness of its own selfish pursuits on the world stage. This lack of awareness isn't benign; it turns into a form of karma, creating cycles of reactivity that can undermine relationships and stability.

### The Multifaceted Objectives of Politics

- **Power and Resource Distribution**: Contrary to popular belief, it's not just Marxists who are concerned with resource allocation. Corporations, individuals, political factions—all are vying for a piece of the pie.
    
- **Minimizing Brutality**: Ideally, politics aims to create a level playing field, reducing systemic oppression and individual brutality. This is a long-term project but crucial for societal health.
    
- **Infrastructure and Systems**: It's about creating frameworks that can handle increased complexity and enable greater freedoms—think legal systems, transportation networks, or healthcare.
    
- **Community Building**: Beyond just utility, politics fosters community. Whether it's a sports event, a religious gathering, or even a national holiday, these are mediums through which a sense of collective identity and purpose are reinforced.
    
- **Evolution and Higher-order Complexity**: Politics is also about the unfolding of larger, more complex systems over time—what you might call "higher holons."
    
- **Consensus amid Diversity**: It's an intricate dance, trying to create policies that satisfy a diverse population with disparate needs and agendas. Not everyone will be happy, but the aim is to make decisions that serve the greater good.
    
- **Cultural Influence**: Politics isn't just about managing what is, but also about shaping what could be. Through debates, culture wars, and even outright conflict, political movements aim to steer the collective ethos in a direction that benefits their own tribe or ideology.
    

### The Improvised Nature of Morality and Decision-Making

In this complex landscape, there's no universal "right" or "wrong." We're all improvising, trying to navigate a constantly shifting terrain of needs, resources, and cultural narratives. It's less about finding the perfect solution and more about engaging in a perpetual balancing act.
