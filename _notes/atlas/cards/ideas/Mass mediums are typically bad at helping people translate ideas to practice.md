Books, videos, and other typical mass media are not themselves examples of a [[Participatory environment]], but they also usually don’t do a good job of facilitating external participation, outside the context of those media. This is another way of saying that they usually fail to create an [[Enabling environment]].

There’s an important disconnect between the experience of consuming the informational media and the experience of _doing_ something with it. This is partially a temporal issue: the material needs to transcend the confined time period in which you read it ([Mass mediums mostly lack an authored time dimension beyond a day](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zBcm1RNbzedjDMTt8rRxoWt)). But there’s also a context issue here.

[MOOC](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zPkHqz9QohuTWfr34Kx8uVH)s attempt to solve this but largely fail. It’s worth reflecting more on why.

One potential solution is [[Enacted experiences have incredible potential as a mass medium]]. There are probably others.

> …the first -largest mistake in my writing … was that I didn’t realize that the big problem in learning this valuable way of thinking was figuring out how to practice it, not knowing the theory. I didn’t realize that part was the priority; and regarding this I can only say “Oops” and “Duh.”

Q. What does Elizier Yudkowsky regard as the largest mistake he made when blogging on Less Wrong?  
A. Focusing on theory instead of practice.
