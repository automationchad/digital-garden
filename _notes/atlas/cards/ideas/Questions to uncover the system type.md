- Listen For: Confusion; lack of understanding about the process; uncertainty about what is needed; phrases like "we don't really understand...", "we're not sure how to...", "it's all a bit unclear...".

When we use concrete examples of how the system might work in our conversations, it makes it easier to spot the things we’ve missed.

Being able to tell the difference between a complex problem and complicated problem can help ensure that the conversations are the most interesting and effective conversations we can have.

> Given a context, when an event happens then an outcome should occur.

There are two questions we should ask when talking through scenarios.

The first _context questioning_:

<aside> 🚨 Is there any other context in which this event would produce a different outcome?

</aside>

And the second _outcome questioning_:

<aside> 🚨 Is there any other outcome that’s also important?

</aside>

Example: If we were designing a cash machine, the two questions would remind us that some customers have overdrafts, and we need to debit the account as well as giving the customer money.

The most interesting responses are when the business stakeholders reply with:

> “Oh, I’m not sure! I hadn’t thought of that.”

At that point, we can stop trying to do analysis – we’ve just found uncertainty; we’re in the complex domain, and we can focus on getting feedback rather than forcing the client to clarify the requirements.

> 📜 Remember when PS at [Tray.io](http://Tray.io) would try and force the client for more clarification on what Fields, Objects and Endpoints should we be using?
> 
> The reason that this would piss people off is because we’re either:
> 
> a) In the complex domain and the client doesn’t know what those requirements are; OR
> 
> b) In the complicated domain and the client doesn’t have that expertise to come up with the solution;
> 
> Note that both revolve around OUR expertise to figure it out for them, they are NOT paying us to “**steal their watch and then tell them the time”**

Conversely, if we spot the conversations becoming boring, with people yawning or drifting off, then we know we’re trying to apply a complex thought process to a complicated or obvious domain and we can say:

> “Okay, I think we understand this well enough”

And there may be better ways to get the requirements than having yet more boring conversations — like submitting an online form with the desired scope.

**Analysis, whether through conversation or otherwise, works best when things are a bit complicated.**

**Brainstorming works best when things are a bit complex**

When you know how to spot the extremes on either side, you’ll know how to focus your conversations better and make them count.
