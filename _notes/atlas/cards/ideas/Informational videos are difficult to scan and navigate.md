Lecture videos, tutorials, and livestreams are somewhat opaque objects. The medium is most naturally viewed linearly. That works well for narratives, but much less well for informational content, which is sometimes best consumed (or referred to) non-linearly.

Some attempts to solve this:

- Twitch et al’s “clips” / “highlights” features, which allow post-hoc segments to be labeled and surfaced
