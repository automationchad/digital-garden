Preselection is the attraction that comes from “passive” indicators. These aren’t the things you “do” or that you “are,” rather they’re _the things you have working in your favor._ This ranges from the stuff you wear and own, to the way you look, to the way people treat you. When you think of a man’s preselection, think of his physique, fame, popularity, and wealth. As a general rule, if it makes him valuable to other people, it makes him preselected. Indeed, this is most observed in the realm of _opportunities_. You see, preselection does little for making girls actually “like” you. What it does do, however, is make girls **disposed** to like you. This means that the more preselection you have, _the more girls are going to be interested in getting to know you._

In business, preselection refers to the initial perception others have of your company based on external indicators such as your reputation, client base, or even the physical appearance of your office space. Leveraging preselection effectively means building a strong brand and fostering positive relationships with key stakeholders. When other companies see you working with reputable clients and delivering high-quality products or services, it enhances your business's attractiveness. It can create opportunities by drawing potential clients, partners, or investors towards your company before any direct interaction takes place.
