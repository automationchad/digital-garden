Thereâ€™s building to create something beautiful.

And then thereâ€™s building to maintain for the cheapest price.

The Romans built for beautiful.

[[True ownership comes from creating something beautiful.]]

America now builds to maintain. The most profitable.

Do you know what the easiest to maintain plants are? 

Desert shrubs.

They sit there. They donâ€™t need watering. 

But guess what?

Theyâ€™re an ugly plant.

They don't flower.

They're usually sharp and dangerous.
