Why are [Tools for thought](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z88M2wwQ8FggV7p8Wu1b8LG) so rarely produced by industry work?

- [[Effective system design requires insights drawn from serious contexts of use]], but [[Tool-makers usually lack connection to a serious context of use]]
- [[Focus on power over scale for transformative system design]]
- [[Deep research requires a slower pace than tech industry work]]
