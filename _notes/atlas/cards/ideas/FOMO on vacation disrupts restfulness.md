When on vacation, there’s often all kinds of activities and sightseeing available. The mere presence of such possibilities creates the sense that one must decide: which things should you go see, and when? Which will you skip? Wrong answers will mean that you’ll be “missing out”! This is fine if the trip is about travel and adventure, but if it’s about relaxation, a fear of missing out will harm restfulness. [[Beware a sense of “should”]]
