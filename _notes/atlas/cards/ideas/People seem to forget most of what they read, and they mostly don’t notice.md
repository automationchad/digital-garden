It seems that most people can remember only a few high-level details of a book weeks later—if that. A typical reader might spend hours finishing some serious non-fiction—then maybe it comes up at a dinner party, and they find you can remember like three sentences. Basically no detailed recall. Barely the gist!

What’s more: people seem surprised when this happens. They seem to consistently overestimate how much they’re absorbing from a book.

Part of the problem here is [[People often struggle to remember details of prose text because they never processed them in the first place]].

See [[How rapidly do people forget practical knowledge?]]

This observation is unfortunate for many reasons, but among them: [[Deep understanding requires detailed knowledge of fundamentals]] and [[Complex ideas may be hard to learn in part because their components overflow working memory]].

For common objections: [[Many people view memory as unimportant to deep creative work]].

- In a limited experimental setting, grad students are given an expository passage; they read once, twice, or three times; delayed (one week) free recall scores at 27% (main idea) and 16% (details) after one reading; cued recall scores at 57% and 64% respectively. Re-reading helps a bit in the cued setting, but not much in for freed recall.
