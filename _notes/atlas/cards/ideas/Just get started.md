When a project I’m supposedly interested in completing seems too hard, and I keep finding myself flinching away from it (or falling into [[Dark playground]])—try instead just getting started! Activities feel totally different once I’m actually in motion.

Q. Why does “[[Just get started]]” help, in terms of our relationship to a task?  
A. Getting started changes our perceptions of a task—once we start, it’s rarely as aversive as we feared.

Proposed [[Just get started]] implementation intention: _when_ I {feel an impulse to delay a task until later, _then_ get started on some aspect of it}.

Q. Why does [[Just get started]] often seem harder than it really is?  
A. You’re thinking about accomplishing the whole task (“getting it done”) rather than just getting started. (see also [[Stop trying to try and try, after Soares]])
