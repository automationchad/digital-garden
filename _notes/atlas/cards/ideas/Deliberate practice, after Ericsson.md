“Deliberate practice” (Ericsson et al, 1993) describes:

- high-effort, high-motivation activities…
- … with the specific goal of improving performance
    - [[Typical work and performance environments don’t constitute deliberate practice]]
- … which are carefully designed (and continuously updated) for that purpose
    - [[Expert coaches facilitate effective deliberate practice]]

- Deliberate practice is generally not regarded as enjoyable; it’s instrumental to improving their performance, not inherently motivating.
- Because deliberate practice is high effort, students can only practice for a limited time each day, and they need the opportunity to recover completely on a regular basis.
- requires legibility for the the student: they must be able to see their progress
- Deliberate practice is incremental: “Deliberate practice nearly always involves building or modifying previously acquired skills by focusing on particular aspects of those skills and working to improve them specifically; over time this step-by-step improvement will eventually lead to expert performance.” (Ericsson and Pool, 2016, p. 100)
