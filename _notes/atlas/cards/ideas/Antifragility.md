*Stronger from stressors!*

Obi-Wan Kenobi's quote from Star Wars always reminds me of Antifragility:

> *"If you strike me down I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine."* 

In a sideways way, this ties into the metaphor of the phoenix being reborn from the ashes of the dragonâ€”and of the hydra having its head cut off, only to have two replace it. 

Using alliteration, it's: getting **stronger from stressors**, more settled from shaking, more adaptable from attacks.

In a way, antifragility is a faster form of [[Natural Selection]].

Antifragility is closely related to resilience/robustness, although resilience shouts *"Still standing after stressors!"*
