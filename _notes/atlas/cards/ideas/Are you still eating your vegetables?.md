**You could earn a million dollars and your Mum would still ask you “But are you still eating your vegetables?”**

This is the nature of the feminine.

> “Your Mum doesn’t expect you to bring her gifts, but as long as you are giving gifts to others she is happy.” — My Dad

Just like Life and the universe, it doesn’t care about you “repaying” some debt to it, all it wants for you is to enjoy giving your gifts to the world, to make others happy.

Father is the Material, he’s the person you can tell all your accomplishments to, and he’ll be proud (I won this, I earned this, etc.).

No matter how materially successful you are the Feminine will always ask “But are you happy?” or will test you in some way.

And sometimes, when you ponder that question, you really are reminded of the fact that Life isn’t always about material things.

Mother is the place that you can return to gain perspective of what is most important and remember the principles which began the conquest in the first place. Australia as my home represents the feminine. The heart, the homeland that I am bringing the Masculine material wealth of the USA back to. The USA is not home, it is not the feminine.

Don't mistake comfort for progress. The feminine will keep testing you, pushing you to stay true to your emotional and ethical core. While it's tempting to let your guard down when you're "home," the external world—the wilderness—demands your full attention. You have to be present, conscious, and continually aware of both your internal landscape and your external actions.

So, go ahead and chase those material goals, but never lose sight of the immeasurable, the aspects of life that truly enrich you. Keep that balance, and you'll not only be successful but also fulfilled.
