Navigating a deal isn't about flooding the room with information; it's about precision. Offer just the essentials and keep the rest in reserve. More isn't better; clarity is. Recognize your role in the engagement. Are you a strategist or an executor? Misjudging this can lead to overreach, diminishing trust.
