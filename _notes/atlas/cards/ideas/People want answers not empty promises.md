The old adage that the customer is always right doesn't hold water with those who know better. Great customers seek genuine problem-solving, not a vague assurance that things will be "fixed."

Being proactive is a strategy that pays dividends. Customers respect a proactive approach where you identify and propose improvements before problems even rear their heads. Reactive stances are often seen as damage control, not leadership.

What this boils down to is becoming a reliable partner in your customer's journey. Offer practical solutions and consistent delivery.
