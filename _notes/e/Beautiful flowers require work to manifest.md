Building something extraordinary and awe-inspiring, like the Romans did, is a league apart from just throwing things together for the sake of easy maintenance and max profitability. Rome prioritized grandeur; America nowadays is in the game of low-effort upkeep.

You want an analogy? Consider desert shrubsâ€”ridiculously easy to maintain, sure, but let's not kid ourselves. They're eyesores. No blooming, mostly spiky and hazardous. Why settle for that when we can strive for more? We've got the capability to create something actually remarkable. See: [[True ownership comes from creating something beautiful]]
