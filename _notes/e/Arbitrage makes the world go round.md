Let's begin by cementing the idea that your ability to identify and act upon arbitrage opportunities is the single highest leverage skill that underlies the premise of value creation itself.

It will define what you do, how you do it, and the results you ultimately generate.

If you view your career through this lens, you will spot things other people miss, try things other people won't try, and make money other people won't make.

**So what is arbitrage?**  
  
**The traditional definition:**Â "Arbitrage is the purchase and sale of an asset in order to profit from a difference in the asset's price between markets."

**The reframe I'm offering:**Â "Arbitrage is the difference between what you can do and what someone else can't, won't, or doesn't do."

**You capture value by demonstrating your ability to do something for someone that they didn't know was possible (until you make it abundantly clear byÂ _showing_Â them, which is what this workshop is all about).**

In my observation, people who succeed in continually upgrading their ability to spot and capitalize on arbitrage, view this process as a ladder:Â **We all**Â **start at the bottom, and climb.**
