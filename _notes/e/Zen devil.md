"If you cannot weep with a person who is crying there is no kensho"â€”this quote by Yamada Koun accentuates the importance of compassion and emotional resonance in spiritual pursuits. 
It suggests that a "Zen Devil" could manifest as a detached, faux-enlightened ego that lacks empathy, fooling oneself into believing they've attained a higher state when they're actually emotionally disconnected.

Neo-Advaita is a contemporary interpretation of the non-dual Advaita Vedanta philosophy. It often comes under criticism for bypassing traditional practices and teachings, thus offering 'instant enlightenment'. A "Zen Devil" in this context could be the superficial or misguided adoption of Neo-Advaita principles without a deep, experiential understanding, thus leading to an inflated ego rather than true non-duality.

Mount Hiei in Japan is a sacred mountain associated with Japanese Buddhism, particularly the Tendai school. The rigorous, ascetic practices performed here contrast with the armchair spirituality that can be termed as "Zen Devil" activity. A half-hearted approach to enlightenment is unlikely to survive the disciplined environment of Mount Hiei, revealing the "Zen Devil" as the ego's unwillingness to commit fully to the spiritual path.

The ego indeed has a tendency to co-opt spiritual techniques for its own survival, creating distractions to prevent a true spiritual journey.
