This is an intentionally quite vague question.

In [Quantum Country](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zNVVrcxnkjk7pCabiBvaic1): [QCVC questions are initially forgotten at very different rates](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z2QUUpeEhCG3JoqesjdXnbW)

A more conservative figure in medicine:

> Medical students forget roughly {25–35} percent of basic science knowledge after {one year}, more than {50} percent by {the next year} (Custers, 2010), and {80–85} percent after {25 years} (Custers & ten Cate, 2011).

Reading natural text in a contrived experimental setting, Amlund et al (1986) find <50% free recall minutes later, even when readers knew it was a test.
