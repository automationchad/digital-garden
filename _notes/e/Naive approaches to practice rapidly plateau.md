If you want to pick up a new skill, like sketching, you might read some books, take a few lessons, then repeat the basic procedures you’ve seen until they’re comfortable. This approach often plateaus rapidly once you reach a basic level of automaticity. Ericsson and Pool (2016) call this “{naive practice}”: a student {performs an action repeatedly}, expecting that {repetition alone} will {improve performance} (p. 14), contra [[Skill development requires challenging homeostasis]]. [[Performance plateaus often require a change in approach to surmount]].

The naive approach to practice might be best summarized by this exchange between a music teacher and his student: “How did you practice it?” “{I dunno. I just played it.}” (Oare, 2012).

Empirical examples:

- In a series of experiments on [Span of working memory](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z3zo16mx2Dp3PB4J1ty1DGy), Chase and Ericsson report that subjects’ naive strategies—rehearsing digit sequences aloud—consistently lead to a plateau (1981, p. 146).

This may partially explain [[Note-writing practices are generally ineffective]]: anecdotally, most people seemed to spend some ineffectual effort thinking about note-taking practices in school, reached a level of automaticity, then stopped thinking about it again. It may also explain aspects of [[Core practices in knowledge work are often ad-hoc]] (e.g. [[Knowledge workers usually have no specific methods for developing ideas over time]]).
