Most people are obsessed with the illusion of growth, focusing solely on the upward trajectory of their lives. They want the bigger house, the flashier car, the corner office. But true wealth isn't just about growing "taller"; it's about growing "deeper." Think of it as setting up a system where your roots extend further into the ground each day. One day, you wake up and realize that you're not just rich, you're wealthyâ€”in a position where you don't "need" to work for income anymore.
