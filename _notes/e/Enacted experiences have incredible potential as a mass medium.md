I believe it’s possible to create an [[Enacted experience]] with the primary purpose of communicating ideas, values, and practices—akin to doing the “job” of a book. This is a powerful proposition because [[Enacted experiences can create intense personal connection to authored targets]] and [[Enacted experiences can bootstrap active participation in enabling environments]].

Avenues:

- Apprenticeships and other social institutions (e.g. YC) do this today, but those aren’t mass media forms ([[Enacted experiences are hard to distribute]]
- Video games are a mass medium, but they’re used almost exclusively to convey aesthetic experiences, not as part of an enabling environment
- Meditation apps are a promising reference: [Guided meditation apps deliver enacted experiences in a mass medium](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zN7KLBKWMTmFqthmFPVSNbP)

I see this as one of the core ideas of [The Primer++](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zWxp9Cw9Nc7ixAGAaXwqq3H).

There seems to be some essential tension here with [[Interaction is a cost center in interface design]].
