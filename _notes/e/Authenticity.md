**Authenticity** is a concept of personality in the fields of psychology, [existential psychotherapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_psychotherapy "Existential psychotherapy"), [existentialist philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existentialism "Existentialism"), and [[§Aesthetics|aesthetics]]. In existentialism, authenticity is the degree to which a person's actions are congruent with their [[My Virtues|values]] and desires, despite external pressures to social conformity. The [conscious Self](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness "Consciousness") comes to terms with the condition of _[Geworfenheit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrownness "Thrownness")_, of having been _thrown_ into an [absurd world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absurdism "Absurdism") (without values and meaning) not of their own making, thereby encountering external forces and influences different from and other than [the Self](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_self "Philosophy of self").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authenticity_(philosophy)#cite_note-2) A person’s lack of authenticity is considered *[[Bad faith]]* in dealing with other people and with one's self; thus, authenticity is in the instruction of the [[Oracle of Delphi]]: “[[Know thyself]].”

Authenticity is very powerful. You want to be natural and honest as much as humanly possible. Then no one can question you, and you are 100% aligned.

Don't be afraid to express your quirks, your life story (not matter how embarrassing or pitiful), your tastes, your opinions. If you're not expressing yourself with friends, family, at work, spouse, strangers, etc. then you won't ever be happy. Work out the inner blocks that are keeping you from being expressive around people. Once you do, you'll be more creative, more unique, more confident, more present, more comfortable, and people will like you more!

There seems to a contradiction in advice. On the one hand, be your authentic self. On the other hand, do self-improvement. Which is it? Being your authentic self requires self improvement. There is just too much psychic grind obscuring your natural, vibrant, confident self. Being your authentic self requires improving your self-image, clearing out limiting beliefs, removing destructive habits, identifying your values, etc. If you tell the average bum on the street to be his authentic self, he will be a dingy, self-destructive fuck-up caught up in low-consciousness. Your authentic self should desire to be the best that it can be. Being your authentic self takes time and work because of all the bad conditioning you received.
