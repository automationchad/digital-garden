>ðŸ’¡ Vastly underrated predictor of success: willingness to be low-status.

Everyone drones on about stuff like hard work, but so many of the top people I've met were uniquely willing to spend years looking like they're working on something silly or insignificant.

I would argue this is a side effect of a more fundamental character trait:

**Knowing very clearly and to a high degree of confidence what it is they want to do with their time/resources, independent of the in-vogue pursuit of the voices around them.**

To have high goals and be very ambitious but willing to mop floors and scrub toilets. Highly underrated character traits.

> You often have to descend the local peak for any hope at all at ascending toward what may be the global peak. People seem bad at this, unless they start early and develop a taste for it.

Cultivate the requisite humility and status masochism while you still can.
