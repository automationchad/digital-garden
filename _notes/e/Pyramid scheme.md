A **pyramid scheme** is a business model that recruits members via a promise of payments or services for enrolling others into the scheme, rather than supplying investments or sale of products. As recruiting multiplies, recruiting becomes quickly impossible, and most members are unable to profit; as such, pyramid schemes are unsustainable and often illegal.

Pyramid schemes have existed for at least a century in different guises. Some [[Ponzinomics, the Untold Story of Multi-Level Marketing - Rob Fitzpatrick]] plans have been classified as pyramid schemes.

Note: A lot of pyramid scheme marketing tactics parallel [[§Cult psychology]]

## Relation to Ponzi schemes

While often confused with each other, pyramid schemes and [[Ponzi scheme]] are different. Pyramid schemes are based on [[network marketing]], where each person in the pyramid is tasked with bringing in their own subordinates and in turn profiting from their sales or recruitments. This fails because it essentially requires an infinite number of people to join the company. In a Ponzi scheme, however, participants are promised returns on "investments", supposedly into stocks or goods, but which are actually paid for by new investors, while a central leading figure takes a portion as profit.
