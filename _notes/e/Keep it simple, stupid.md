The principle finds its origins in similar [[minimalism|minimalist]] concepts, such as:

- [[Occam's razor]]
- [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication";
- [Shakespeare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespeare "Shakespeare")'s "Brevity is the soul of wit";
- [Mies van der Rohe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mies_van_der_Rohe "Mies van der Rohe")'s "[[Less is more]] "Less is more (architecture)")";
- [Bjarne Stroustrup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bjarne_Stroustrup "Bjarne Stroustrup")'s "Make Simple Tasks Simple!";
- [Dr. Seuss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Seuss "Dr. Seuss")'s ode to brevity: "So the writer who breeds more words than he needs, is making a chore for the reader who reads."
- [Johan Cruyff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_Cruyff "Johan Cruyff")'s "Playing football is very simple but playing simple football is the hardest thing there is";
- [Antoine de Saint Exupéry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_de_Saint_Exup%C3%A9ry "Antoine de Saint Exupéry")'s "It seems that perfection is reached not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away";
- [Colin Chapman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Chapman "Colin Chapman"), the founder of [Lotus Cars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_Cars "Lotus Cars"), urged his designers to "Simplify, then add lightness";
- Attributed to [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein"), although this may be an editor's paraphrase of a lecture he gave. "Make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler".
- [Steve Jobs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs "Steve Jobs")'s "~~Simplify~~, ~~Simplify~~, Simplify",[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle#cite_note-11)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle#cite_note-12) which simplified [Henry David Thoreau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_David_Thoreau "Henry David Thoreau")'s quote "Simplify, simplify, simplify." for emphasis.
- [Northcote Parkinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._Northcote_Parkinson "C. Northcote Parkinson"), British academic and sometimes military officer and military critic, expressed this idea as "Parkinson's Third Law" (ca. 1957): "Expansion means complexity and complexity, decay; or to put it even more plainly—the more complex, the sooner dead."

Contra: [[Heath Robinson]] contraptions and [[Rube Goldberg's machines]], intentionally overly-complex solutions to simple tasks or problems, are humorous examples of "non-KISS" solutions.
