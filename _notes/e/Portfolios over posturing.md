No one cares what you can do, everyone cares what you can do for them.

The thing I learned very early in my career is that no one cared about my degree.

They just wanted to see my portfolio.

But if I were to start over, I’d do things a little differently.

The projects in my portfolio weren’t self-directed, they were assignments given to me from a templated curriculum.

Did they communicate my unique interests? No.

Did they communicate my unique ability? Not really.

In my case, the work I’d done was intended to convince a would-be-employer that I can handle whatever random project is thrown at me. There’s a word for that: a generalist.

The world is different now. You can build a very healthy business making YouTube thumbnails if you’re so inclined.

Think someone could be doing a better job of x? **Don’t tell them, show them.**

The projects in your portfolio are **assets** that will continue to deliver value long after the time you spent building them.

Let’s get tangible for a second.

Two candidates show up for a job interview.

One just graduated from a good school and has a self-proclaimed “good work ethic.” (Despite never having had a job.)

The other put together a pitch to explain a new way to frame your value proposition to your enterprise prospects.

**Which one is getting the job?**

Working independently works exactly the same way.  
Except there are millions of people hiring at all times.

If your favorite podcaster keeps posting episodes with messed up levels, send them a fixed version.  

Your favorite writer's website is awful? Rebuild it and send it to them.

A community you're a part of is doing a bad job of capturing social proof? Interview 10 members and send them finished marketing assets.

**Last thing you need?**  
A place to put proof.

**Writing?** Blog about your process and untangle how you solve problems, tweet your best insights and write emails that reflect on your progress each week.

**Making things?** Publish your permissionless projects, document your work in progress. Use a portfolio site like Dribbble, or build your own with Wordpress, Webflow, Carrd, or Instapage.

**Making videos?** Build up a YouTube channel to document your process, reflect on your work in more detail, and/or expand on your writing.
