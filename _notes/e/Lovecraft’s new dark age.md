Lovecraft argues that our relentless pursuit of knowledge could backfire spectacularly, pushing us to the brink of insanity or into a self-imposed ignorance—a "new dark age." He's saying, be careful what you wish for; the more we know, the more we might regret it.

Lovecraft's notion of the "New Dark Age" isn't a formally articulated philosophical concept in his body of work, but the idea can be extrapolated from his themes and narrative choices Lovecraft often depicted a world in which humanity's progress—scientific, moral, and societal—could be undone by forces that are both ancient and cosmic. These forces are not evil in a conventional sense; they are indifferent to human existence, and their awakening or intervention could trigger a catastrophic regression, effectively plunging humanity into a new dark age.

> The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents. We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far. The sciences, each straining in its own direction, have hitherto harmed us little; but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the light into the peace and safety of a new Dark Age. - H.P. Lovecraft

This idea stems from his larger philosophy, [[Cosmicism]], which essentially tells us we're insignificant specs in a vast, indifferent universe. He's speculating on the risks of our own curiosity, especially when it reveals how inconsequential we are on a cosmic scale.

In a modern context, Lovecraft's ideas can be related to existential risks that are being discussed in scientific and philosophical circles—topics like artificial intelligence, bioengineering, and even cosmic events like asteroid impacts or gamma-ray bursts. Each of these could theoretically result in a new dark age of sorts, where human civilization as we know it takes a significant step backward or even faces extinction.

Politically, "new dark age" also has undertones of Lovecraft's own xenophobia. Some argue that his concept could be tied to a wider fear of societal shifts and the unknown—though that's a separate discussion.

This isn't just dated philosophy; it's highly relevant to current debates on the ethics and dangers of rapid scientific and tech advancements. It's a timeless caution about the double-edged sword that is [[Curiosity killed the cat|human curiousity]].

### Core Themes:

1. **Cosmic Indifference**: Lovecraft's cosmic entities are not concerned with human well-being. Their actions, or even mere presence, can lead to chaos, disrupting the perceived order and progress of human civilization.
    
2. **Knowledge as a Double-Edged Sword**: Lovecraft often portrayed the pursuit of forbidden or arcane knowledge as perilous. Gaining such knowledge might offer momentary insight but at the cost of mental stability, societal order, or both.
    
3. **Incomprehensible Forces**: The cosmic forces or entities in Lovecraft's tales are beyond human comprehension. Their motives (if they even have any) are unfathomable to humans. Understanding or confronting these entities often results in madness or existential despair.
    
4. **Fragility of Civilization**: Lovecraft’s stories often hint at the fragility of human accomplishments. All our advances in science and society are precarious and can be undone, revealing a lurking chaos.
    
5. **Moral and Cultural Relativism**: The "New Dark Age" could also imply a dismantling of moral and cultural frameworks, given that these are human-centric constructs meaningless to cosmic entities.
