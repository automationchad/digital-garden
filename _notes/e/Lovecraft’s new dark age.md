Lovecraft argues that our relentless pursuit of knowledge could backfire spectacularly, pushing us to the brink of insanity or into a self-imposed ignorance—a "new dark age." He's saying, be careful what you wish for; the more we know, the more we might regret it.

> The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents. We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far. The sciences, each straining in its own direction, have hitherto harmed us little; but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the light into the peace and safety of a new Dark Age. - H.P. Lovecraft

This idea stems from his larger philosophy, [[Cosmicism]], which essentially tells us we're insignificant specs in a vast, indifferent universe. He's speculating on the risks of our own curiosity, especially when it reveals how inconsequential we are on a cosmic scale.

Politically, "new dark age" also has undertones of Lovecraft's own xenophobia. Some argue that his concept could be tied to a wider fear of societal shifts and the unknown—though that's a separate discussion.

This isn't just dated philosophy; it's highly relevant to current debates on the ethics and dangers of rapid scientific and tech advancements. It's a timeless caution about the double-edged sword that is [[Curiosity killed the cat|human curiousity]].
