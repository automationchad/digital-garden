The **productivity paradox**, also referred to as the **Solow paradox**, could refer either to the slowdown in [productivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity "Productivity") growth in the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States") in the 1970s and 1980s despite rapid development in the field of [information technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology "Information technology") (IT) over the same period, or to the slowdown in productivity growth in the United States and [developed countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developed_countries "Developed countries") from the 2000s to 2020s; sometimes the newer slowdown is referred to as the **productivity slowdown**, the **productivity puzzle**, or the **productivity paradox 2.0**. The 1970s to 1980s productivity paradox inspired many research efforts at explaining the slowdown, only for the paradox to disappear with renewed productivity growth in the developed countries in the 1990s. However, issues raised by those research efforts remain important in the study of productivity growth in general, and became important again when productivity growth slowed around the world again from the 2000s to the present day.
