Growth DOES NOT EQUAL Prosperity

We often end up pursuing growth when we really want to secure prosperity.

Unlike prosperity, growth is dependent on constant surplus and continual expansion.

Growth is increasing the number of units.

Prosperity is increasing the value of existing units.

This is an interesting concept that I think might explain why Progress and Poverty exist.

**We were using all the surplus money and wealth to fund addition of the units versus improving the quality of the units.**

What you end up with is a society that looks great on the surface but nothing deeper.

How is it that we have $3,500 goggles with screens yet the roads outside my doorstep are literally crumbling from lack of maintenance?

To me technological progress that‚Äôs being made now is more of an escape from the dystopia that no one cares to fix rather than an ascension of our consciousness.

It‚Äôs the Ego‚Äôs way of sweeping things under the rug.

So then my big play is thinking [[how do we increase the prosperity of our own lives as well as the people around us?]]
