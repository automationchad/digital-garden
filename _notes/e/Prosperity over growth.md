Growth DOES NOT EQUAL Prosperity

We often end up pursuing growth when we really want to secure prosperity.

Unlike prosperity, growth is dependent on constant surplus and continual expansion.

Growth is increasing the number of units.

Prosperity is increasing the value of existing units.

This is an interesting concept that I think might explain why Progress and Poverty exist.

**We were using all the surplus money and wealth to fund addition of the units versus improving the quality of the units.**

What you end up with is a society that looks great on the surface but nothing deeper.

How is it that we have $3,500 goggles with screens yet the roads outside my doorstep are literally crumbling from lack of maintenance?

To me technological progress that‚Äôs being made now is more of an escape from the dystopia that no one cares to fix rather than an ascension of our consciousness.

It‚Äôs the Ego‚Äôs way of sweeping things under the rug.

So then my big play is thinking how do we increase the prosperity of our own lives as well as the people around us?

And that‚Äôs when I think about real estate

It is not just about owning a property, but about understanding the bedrock upon which it stands.

Real estate is not just about structures; it is fundamentally about land.

A house, no matter how grand, is only as valuable as the land upon which it sits.

This is why the humblest dwelling in California may fetch a higher price than the grandest mansion in Columbia.

It is not about the structure, but the location.

The same materials, the same architect, the same builder, but vastly different values based on the geographic coordinates.

A powerful reminder of the fundamental importance of place.

The question then is not just about whether to invest in the house or the land, but rather, how to enhance the value of the land.

And the answer to that lies in city planning and infrastructure.

This is where the [real value creation]([[True ownership comes from creating something beautiful.]]) happens.

It‚Äôs an interplay between the Roman ideals of beauty in our creations and an understanding of the infrastructure that underpins our reality.

It means focusing on improving infrastructure, on enhancing the fabric of the city, on making the land more valuable.

It means thinking about how to create a city that is not just habitable, but desirable, a city that not only meets the basic needs of its residents, but also inspires and uplifts them.

This is not a simple task. It requires a deep understanding of the fundamentals, a clear vision of what could be, and the courage to make it happen.

But the rewards can be great. By investing in infrastructure and city planning, we can not only increase the value of our real estate, but also enhance the quality of life for all who live there.

It is this difference in infrastructure, in planning and vision, that sets societies apart.

It is why some nations prosper while others struggle.

It is not just about resources, but about how those resources are used.

This is the essence of value creation.

This is the power of fundamentals.

This is the real estate strategy for the ages.

Expanding your scope, Will, is the key to elevating our game in real estate beyond the reach of most.

We must focus on the quality of the locations we invest in.

This echoes your sentiment about creators.

Creators are the builders.

We are the ones who CREATE the reality in which people live.

We are akin to the architects of the Duomo or the painters of the Sistine Chapel.

Landlords, on the other hand, resemble the rank politicians in Rome, claiming what isn't theirs and feeling entitled to the spoils.

However, the truth is... they don't possess TRUE ownership at all.

They didn't build the structure.

They didn't transmute the abstract into the concrete.

Thought into action.

Theory into practice.

In the likeness of how God created the universe

Consequently, they remain fundamentally detached from what they claim to hold.
