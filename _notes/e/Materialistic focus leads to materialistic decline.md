Hoarding anything material creates paradoxes.Â 

On one hand you need to protect your resources so that you can continue to make use of them.

On the other hand identifying with these material resources too much can hurt your capacity to utilise the resources to create more resources.

Why does this happen? [[Fear is there to help you to maintain whatever you identify with]].

Whenever we try to alter our external world without changing our inner world either we fail or we gain today at the expense of tomorrow. Fake things cannot last forever ([[Mirror principle]], [[Vital architecture]])

Some potential solutions: [[Non-identification]], [[Non-coercive productivity]]
