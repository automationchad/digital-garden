When it comes to integration discussions at [[Motis Group]], we often find ourselves starting at step 2: Building an [[API gateway building]]. However, this approach frequently serves as a makeshift solution, a form of technological duct tape, if you will.

The issue usually stems from the client's prior choices. Whether they've selected an ill-suited system for a particular business function, or their existing software doesn't integrate well with databases, we're constrained by the technology they've already invested in.

That's precisely where our system design package comes into play. Instead of working around existing limitations, we take a ground-up approach to determine what systems need to be implemented. This includes creating detailed diagrams and selecting the most appropriate vendors for the task at hand.

By doing this, we not only provide a comprehensive solution but also lay a solid foundation for initial discussions concerning the [[API gateway building]]. This way, the gateway becomes a strategic element of the integration, rather than a patchwork fix.
