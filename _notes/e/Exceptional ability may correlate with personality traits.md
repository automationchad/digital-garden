- Feist’s 1998 meta-analysis of personality studies comparing creative vs. less-creative scientists reports:
    - [California Psychological Inventory](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zY25cEZM97Ak78qZZCAFv7Z): creative scientists have higher scores in tolerance (d = 0.77), self-acceptance (d = 0.69), flexibility (d = 0.55), dominance (d = 0.53), intellectual efficiency (d = 0.52), achievement via independence (d = 0.50), psychological mindedness (d = 0.50).
    - [Five-factor model](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zRgWr67tKQYxtPoxWgRvKV6): creative scientists more extraverted (d = 0.39) and open to experience (d = 0.31)
- Hall and MacKinnon (1969) report correlates between the “creativity ratings” of professional architects (as assessed by a survey of professors) and [California Psychological Inventory](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zY25cEZM97Ak78qZZCAFv7Z) scales. Their best fit found correlations between creativity ratings and of achievement via independence (r=1.015), femininity (r=0.990), and social presence (0.547).
