There's nothing wrong with being a Landlord.

It's when landlordism exists separate from the laborer that issues begin.

Landlords that sit outside of labor are not value creators. Sure, they might own property, but what's ownership without creation? It's hollow. 

In a financialized economy, banks and landlords earn money (interest and rent, respectively) based more on ownership and control rather than actual value creation.

[[Vital architecture]] -- improving the fabric of a city, the land, the infrastructure—real, tangible contributions that elevate the quality of life. That's where true ownership comes from, by shaping the reality in which people live.

Contrast that with landlords. They're more akin to the Jewish usurer's—staking claims on things they didn't build or improve. They're not the architects of the Duomo or the Michelangelos behind the Sistine Chapel. They haven't transmuted the abstract into the concrete. Thought into action. Theory into practice. They're disconnected from the essence of what they claim to own (interest payments on money created out of debt that doesn't exist), so any talk of "ownership" is nothing more than a legal technicality.
