Landlords are not value creators. Sure, they might own property, but what's ownership without creation? It's hollow. In my earlier piece about infrastructure, I hammered on the essence of value creation. It's about improving the fabric of a city, the land, the infrastructure—real, tangible contributions that elevate the quality of life. That's where true ownership comes from, by shaping the reality in which people live.

Contrast that with landlords. They're more akin to Rome's rank politicians—staking claims on things they didn't build or improve. They're not the architects of the Duomo or the Michelangelos behind the Sistine Chapel. They haven't transmuted the abstract into the concrete ([[Vital architecture]]). Thought into action. Theory into practice. They're disconnected from the essence of what they claim to own, so any talk of "ownership" is nothing more than a legal technicality.
