1. Countries you spend money in. You usually live and regulations do not matter as you're a permanent tourist.
2. Countries for shell company/private asset management purposes. Impenetrable by foreign governments.
3. Countries you extract value from. Low/no tax, bendable legislation, anything for a price etc. Great for revenue operations
