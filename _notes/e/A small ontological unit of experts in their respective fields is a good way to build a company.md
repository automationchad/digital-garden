In building a company, an elite cadre of experts, each a master in their respective domains, can be a force multiplier. The problem that sabotages most companies isn't a lack of vision, but a failure in execution. It's a disconnect between intent and infrastructure, caught in a Catch-22: you need money to build the infrastructure and infrastructure to make money. So what's the move?

Look to the Ocean's 11 paradigm: a lean, specialised team where expertise triumphs over formal roles. Each member is a Swiss Army knife of skills. Take Rusty—he's not just a guy in the background; he recruits, plans, observes, impersonates, and even masters the craft's subtleties. In today's tech landscape, such versatility is gold. Software tools have evolved to amplify individual impact on revenue, user metrics, or any KPI you care about.

But here's the catch: as you scale, you risk diluting what matters most—creating an exceptional product. You start building an empire of red tape instead of a product delivery powerhouse. Examples of a bureaucracy below:

**Meetings**
- Rob your builders of precious time
- Breed a culture of endless consensus
- Put progress on ice with "follow-up" delays
- 1:1s silo decisions
- Shift focus from results to rhetoric (contra: [[Be pragmatic rather than dogmatic]])

**Process**
- slows cycles (follow the gates)
- diffuses ownership
- creates over-specialization (and it’s partner: *over-hiring*)
- abstracts away decision making
- errs to complexity vs simplicity 

**Policy**

Generally, across everything from HR, finance, security, IT, etc.

- encourages risk aversion
- keeps teams from exercising risk-adjusted judgement
- slows cycles (blocks & reviews)
- dampens innovation & the art of the possible
- can hurt top talent retention (too structured comp/review cycles)
- can make your hiring process slow and less competitive
- makes experimentation too hard 

**Operating**

- people start to play for promotions, not company growth
- talk more about the how of the work, vs the what and why if the work
- leaders lose track of the details
- teams lose track of the bigger picture
- customers become data points and % rates, not real people with real problems (See: [[Scale can kill authenticity]], [[Goodhart's Law]]).

Processes, meetings, policies—they're not inherently bad; they're needed for scale and reliability. But if you're not vigilant, these become weeds choking your organization. Act immediately. Cut the deadwood. Be ruthless.

Experiment with audacious moves. Cancel all meetings for a week. Push changes to production more recklessly than you're comfortable with. Shake the tree. Small teams allow for greater individual ownership, usually translating into superior quality.

Remember, show and tell isn't just for kids. Be the one who does and teaches. Maintain that startup agility, that sense of ownership, because the moment you lose that, you're not steering the ship—you're just cargo.
