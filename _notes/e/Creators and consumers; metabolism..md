The relationship between creators and consumers isn't just symbiotic; it's the very fabric of a larger energetic metabolism that courses through society. Take plants and animals: they're not in equilibrium; they're in a constant exchange of energy, from sunlight to glucose to CO2. The notion of balance is an illusion; what we have instead is a ceaseless, upward flow of energy.

Consider this dynamic as an electrical circuit. In the annals of thought, Blake and Peat encapsulated this perfectly—the Devourer fuels the Prolific. Yet modern society works tirelessly to suppress this natural dichotomy. Efforts to create a uniform middle class, to enforce social equity, ultimately dilute the raw extremes that drive innovation and change. They make us mediocre.

Brute De Force gets it right: the middle is quicksand. It saps your agency, makes you a pawn in someone else's game. The Devourer, especially, falls prey to this, hoodwinked by a culture that seeks to domesticate the very forces that should be wild, untamed. If you need evidence, look no further than the war on human health. The battle over energy regulation isn't a sideline; it's the main event.

Blake warned us—the Prolific and the Devourer are not to be reconciled (See: [[There's no balance, just an upward flow]]). Attempts to do so disrupt the natural order, leading to societal aberrations like the gender wars, the drudgery of corporate life, and so on. Reject this domestication. Your intuition isn't just a feeling; it's your compass, a guide to tapping into raw, elemental forces.

The Prolific needs to be relentless, driven by a mission that burns brighter than a thousand suns. The Devourer should seek out the Prolific, not to undermine them but to fuel their fire. Keep these roles distinct, just as intuition tells you what elements in life must remain separate.

Take a cue from Blake's interpretation of Christ: the goal isn't unity but division. Distinct roles, clear missions. Align yourself firmly with a mission, or fuel someone who has one. That's the path away from the quagmire of mediocrity.
