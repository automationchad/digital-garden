> ppl be like "sex with a bunch of people desensitizes you to sex and makes it less special" but ignore the fact we expect ppl to bang the same damn person for 30+ years and this is magically supposed to be immune from that same problem??

The perception that engaging in physical intimacy with numerous partners desensitizes one to the act is a misleading notion. More pressing than desensitization is the risk of sensitizationâ€”particularly to love, bonding, and the crumbling of shared narratives. Engaging intimately involves not just a physical act but an emotional bond that significantly affects the neuroplasticity of our brain. It results in the formation of new memories, anchored to that individual, and the adjustment of countless cognitive patterns. The simplest experiences, be it a particular song, a drive, or a shared breakfast preference, take on profound significance. The process involves intricately understanding and assimilating subtle behavioral cues from the partner. This understanding, when seen through the lens of long-term commitment, is exponentially beneficial. It equips the brain to perceive one's aging partner through an innate, affectionate lens, making them appear perpetually captivating. However, the flip side of this bond is the emotional turmoil that follows a breakup. The agony echoes through past memories, presenting itself as triggers and emotional barriers that can potentially obstruct future relationships. Hence, the universal advice is often to move past and forget old flames.

Consider those who spend decades with a single partner, such as high school sweethearts. Their journey encapsulates witnessing countless versions of their partner, each version providing a unique perspective and flavor to their bond. This dynamic experience can be contrasted with transient relationships where one only gets to understand their partner in the present context, without any glimpses into past or future potentialities. A foundational understanding of true companionship implies that one's ideal partner isn't someone pre-existing, waiting to be discovered. Instead, it is someone with whom you evolve, adapt, and grow. The process of finding a soulmate isn't about two perfectly matched individuals finding each other (See: [[Perfect for you is recognising no one is perfect]]); it's about two individuals choosing to evolve and shape their futures together, navigating the myriad complexities of life as a cohesive unit.
