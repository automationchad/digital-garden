The concept of non-coercion serves as the foundation upon which I want to design my life. It's the guiding principle that keeps me on track.

So, what's coercion all about? 

> Coercion involves compelling a party to act in an involuntary manner by the use of threats, including threats to use force against that party. It involves a set of forceful actions which violate the *free will* of an individual in order to induce a desired response.

In my worldview, coercion extends beyond mere threats and force. It encapsulates any situation where you're tethered to an external entity‚Äîwhether that's a person, a corporation, a government, or your own self-imposed beliefs ‚Äîthat provides a rulebook for how you should live and act. You're not just reacting to threats; you're being subtly moulded by expectations, norms, or economic necessities.

Following the [[Levels of magnification|levels of magnification]], I see this playing out on 3 planes:

 1. *Institutionally*: Here, you're navigating the systems of governance and societal structures in a way that minimizes coercion and maximizes personal freedom. Put yourself in environments [[Go where you're treated best|where you're treated best]].

 2. *Peer-to-peer*: At this level, it's about forming relationships based on mutual respect and freedom, avoiding manipulative tactics and power plays ([[Anti-marketing]]). This also means not just doing work that pays the bills, but engaging in endeavours that are intrinsically rewarding (See: [[¬ßConscious capitalism]]).

 3. *Intellectually*: This is about sharpening your thinking to ensure you're making decisions from a place of autonomy ([[Do your own thinking]]), not conforming to external pressures or feelings of obligation ([[Non-coercive productivity]]). 

A good heuristic for coercive actions is looking at friction and obligation:

- [[Friction tells us if we're forcing something not meant to be]].
- [[Beware a sense of ‚Äúshould‚Äù]]
