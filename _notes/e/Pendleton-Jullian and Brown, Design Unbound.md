_Design Unbound_ argues that contemporary needs have transcended traditional systems of design, in which there can be known requirements, understood contexts, and deliverable systems. Contemporary contexts are “white-water”: requirements are ever-changing; systems act in the world but also on the world, changing it continuously; the design objects are often _networks of people and systems_ as much as they are objects or mechanisms.

- [[Systems of action, after ApJ and JSB]]
- [[Great creative work is usually the product of a single person]]
    - In tension with the book’s claims: [[Traditional design practices can’t produce systems which require profound subject matter insight]]
