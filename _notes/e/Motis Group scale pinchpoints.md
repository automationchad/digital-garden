**Competition**: With a budget of $500,000, the focus should be on two key areas: pioneering innovative marketing and advertising strategies, and building a robust offers and offer infrastructure. Your ability to generate revenue is directly tied to your strategic choices and operational execution. The critical first milestone is to grow from $0 to $1 million, which is almost entirely dependent on achieving a product-market or service-market fit.

**Instability**: Operating on a $2-4 million budget, your financial modeling skills come into play. It's vital to maintain accurate books and forecasts, attributing historical data to understand the how and why of past performance. Your pricing models need to be dynamic, aligning with the financial constraints and goals of your business. In this stage, robust processes and systems become increasingly critical for stability and growth.

**Labor**: With an $8-12 million budget, team composition becomes crucial. The executive team you assemble will significantly influence your success, as will any strategic partnerships or collaborations with other agencies. For every additional $10,000 in monthly revenue, consider hiring a new employee who will consume around 30-35% of that increment. Effective delegation of tasks, decisions, and strategic direction to top-tier team members is key at this stage.

**Enterprise**: Once you reach $12 million in revenue with stable TTM, your focus should pivot to advanced financial strategies like effective capital allocation and achieving a positive ROIC. The aim should be for each dollar invested to multiply into more capital. Depending on your strategy, either vertical or horizontal integration may be appropriate. At this stage, your services can extend to consulting private equity and VC firms, or directly engaging with startups for equity. Specializing in brokering exit strategies to Big Tech or facilitating IPOs will add another revenue stream.
