In its original incarnation, [LessWrong](https://lesswrong.com/) was a group blog mostly authored by [[Eliezer Yudkowsky]] about thinking more clearly, with emphasis on topics like the AI alignment problem, life extension, and Bayesian reasoning.

In its current incarnation, it’s more like a community forum.
