Studying politics and governance isn't merely an intellectual exercise or a civic duty—it's a deep dive into understanding oneself and human nature. The very issues that plague our political systems—selfishness, bias, ego—are the same issues that we grapple with in our personal lives. Scaling these issues up in the context of governance makes their gravity more palpable.

### Consciousness Level as the Underpinning of Politics

A significant insight emerges: your level of consciousness directly shapes your values and, consequently, your political leanings. Politics becomes less mysterious when understood as an extension of individual and collective consciousness. Many people vote for figures or policies that resonate with their current level of consciousness, often shaped by culture and upbringing rather than independent thought.

### Structural vs. Content-driven Ideologies

When considering political views, it's crucial to distinguish between content and structure. Content refers to specific beliefs and ideologies, like religious affiliation or stance on gun control. Structure, on the other hand, focuses on the underlying cognitive patterns that lead to these beliefs. One's "circle of concern"—the range of entities one cares about—becomes a pivotal aspect of this structure.

### Developmental Psychology and the Expanding Circle of Concern

The concept of an expanding circle of concern offers a framework for understanding how individuals can evolve. At lower levels, one's concern may only extend to themselves or their immediate family. As they progress, they may include their community, nation, or even all of humanity. Ultimately, the circle can widen to embrace all forms of life and, perhaps, the entire universe.

### Moral Development and Political Complexity

Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development provide a structured way to understand how individual morals evolve and thus inform political views. These range from pre-conventional stages, where morality is about avoiding punishment, to post-conventional levels, where individuals question societal norms and create their own moral frameworks. Each stage yields a different perspective on complex issues like abortion, demonstrating how moral development contributes to political complexity.

### Ego Development and Its Influence on Politics

Advancements in ego development, as outlined by psychologists like Susan Cook-Greuter, correlate with a decrease in selfish motivations and a rise in collective thinking. As individuals evolve, they become less likely to vote for leaders who mirror lower levels of ego development—those driven by greed, fear, and division.

### The Path to Conscious Politics: Beyond Identity

The ultimate challenge in achieving more conscious politics lies in transcending our individual and collective identities. This involves dropping indoctrinated beliefs and expanding our circles of concern. The act of stepping out of one's egoic survival agenda enables a more universal, compassionate approach to governance—one that aligns with higher consciousness and broader human evolution.
