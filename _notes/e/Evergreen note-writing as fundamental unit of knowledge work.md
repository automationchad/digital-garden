If you had to set one metric to use as a leading indicator for yourself as a knowledge worker, the best I know might be the number of [[Evergreen notes]] written per day. [[Note-writing can be a virtuosic skill]], but [[Most people use notes as a bucket for storage or scratch thoughts]] and [[Note-writing practices are generally ineffective]].

- [[Evergreen note-writing helps insight accumulate]]
- [[Evergreen note-writing helps reading efforts accumulate]]
- Note-writing helps writing accumulate: these notes are the fuel for the [[Executable strategy for writing]], particularly if you [[Create speculative outlines while you write]].

A caveat: [[“Better note-taking” misses the point; what matters is “better thinking”]]

> If writing is the medium of research and studying nothing else than research, then there is no reason not to work as if nothing else counts than writing.

> Focusing on writing as if nothing else counts does not necessarily mean you should do everything else less well, but it certainly makes you do everything else differently. Having a clear, tangible purpose when you attend a lecture, discussion or seminar will make you more engaged and sharpen your focus.
