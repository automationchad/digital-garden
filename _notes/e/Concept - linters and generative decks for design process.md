Programmers have tools called linters which warn continuously of issues which don’t generate compiler errors, but which are nevertheless “bad practices.” In writing, tools like Grammarly provide hints about when your writing is awkward or unclear. I’d love to have similar tools for the design process. At the comp level, they might focus on failing contrast scores, or interactives where I haven’t defined a “pressed” state. At the conceptual level, they might e.g. double-check about entities which can be created but not destroyed.

A “linter” framing can be tricky in design because heuristics are often fuzzy; “best practices” don’t always apply. A complementary framing might be a generative [[Deck of cards as non-fiction medium]]. Example prompts might include:

- what if the user’s image assets are all really ugly?
- what’s a version of this workflow which moves more of the action into the real world, rather than on a screen?
- what would it mean to make this multiplayer?
- what would it mean to linger over, or to savor, an activity, rather than trying to complete it efficiently?

It would be even more valuable to have these linters and generative cards provided contextually, e.g. within a [[Figma]] canvas and dependent on what I’m looking at in the moment.
