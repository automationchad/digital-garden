Edges linking nodes in information systems (e.g. [[Evergreen notes should be densely linked]]) should themselves be labeled in some way which contextualizes the association. It’s often not enough to say “X is related to Y”: better to say “X goes into more detail about Y in the context of Z.”

The extra context will be a cue for your memory or evaluation of the linked material, which will help you effectively navigate the knowledge graph and retrace your former thought processes.
