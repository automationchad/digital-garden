**Doublethink** is a process of indoctrination in which subjects are expected to simultaneously accept two conflicting beliefs as truth, often at odds with their own memory or sense of reality.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doublethink#cite_note-ocel-1) 

> To know and not to know, to be conscious of complete truthfulness while telling carefully constructed lies, to hold simultaneously two opinions which cancelled out, knowing them to be contradictory and believing in both of them, to use logic against logic, to repudiate morality while laying claim to it, to believe that democracy was impossible and that the Party was the guardian of democracy, to forget whatever it was necessary to forget, then to draw it back into memory again at the moment when it was needed, and then promptly to forget it again, and above all, to apply the same process to the process itself—that was the ultimate subtlety: consciously to induce unconsciousness, and then, once again, to become unconscious of the act of hypnosis you had just performed. Even to understand the word—doublethink—involved the use of doublethink. -- 1984, George Orwell

**Relation to hypocrisy**

Doublethink is related to, but differs from, [[hypocrisy]]. 

In doublethink, you're fully aware of the cognitive dissonance but accept it. In hypocrisy, you might very well be oblivious to the contradiction between your words and deeds.

Doublethink is often imposed or indoctrinated, meant to control or manipulate thought. Hypocrisy is generally a personal moral failing, stemming from weakness, self-interest, or a lack of self-awareness.

Doublethink requires a higher level of cognitive dissonance, juggling conflicting ideas intentionally. Hypocrisy is straightforward; you say one thing and do another.

Doublethink is more pervasive, often infiltrating entire belief systems or societies, making it harder to break free from. Hypocrisy is usually isolated to specific actions or statements, making it easier to address or correct.


Examples:

- "Cancel culture" - One minute, society's preaching the values of tolerance and understanding; the next, it's ready to cancel someone for a decade-old tweet. The dissonance is glaring, but it's accepted, almost normalized.
- "Work-life balance," but you're also subtly encouraged to prioritize work over everything else? It's like being told to sprint and meditate at the same time.
