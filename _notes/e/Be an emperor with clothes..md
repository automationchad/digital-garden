Be an emperor with clothes. If you buy things you donâ€™t need, soon you will have to sell things you do need.

In the realm of opulence, it is vital to discern between luxury and necessity. For even an emperor can be left bare, not by the absence of grandeur but by the folly of excess. Should one indulge in the superfluous, even essential pillars might crumble under pressure. Be judicious in your desires; for in squandering resources on the unessential, you may jeopardize the very essentials that uphold your empire. Be not just an emperor in appearance, but in wisdom and restraint. For in the balance of want and need lies the true essence of enduring majesty.
