[[Games effectively develop players’ skills]], but that’s not the point of the experience: the skills are incidental to intrinsically meaningful purposes—aesthetic, social, narrative, etc. The true purpose is aesthetic, not practical: [[Games are an aesthetic medium of action]]. And that aesthetic is generally guided by [[Find the fun]].

Skill-building is a means for these ends: I want to learn how to fly because it is beautiful. Skill-building is also a natural by-product of those ends: I become better at flying because the environment contains tricky platforms I struggle to reach.

[Educational game](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zPf3vk65fBYtn5iTWj3PTEE) designers ignore this observation and make skill-building itself the primary purpose. Sometimes the player’s presented with some other ostensible purpose (“beat the high score!”), but that’s a thin veneer; it’s obviously not the primary consideration for the designers. These games subvert their own aims: [Educational games are a doomed approach to creating enabling environments](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zUVBJdPc4kBud5fsLmPFpbw).

> I think you’ve definitely got the right idea, thinking about activities with “weight-bearing” concepts. But I think that excessive focus on “are we _teaching_ these concepts, are children _learning_ these concepts” leads to condescending designs, which fail to be either interesting or educational. …

> Maybe instead, design activities where the concepts bear the weight, but focus on making the activity inherently interesting and joyful _for both designer and player._ Ask yourself: “_Do I love playing with this myself?_” And trust that players, by spending hours with these concepts “in their hands”, will pick up a familiarity, then fluency, then understanding, that’s hard to design for explicitly.
