Much of the day-to-day thinking involved in creative work is simply lost, like sand castles in the tide. Ephemerality can actually be useful in low-fidelity thought, but it’s simply an accidental property in many cases. We should do our serious thinking in the form of [[Evergreen notes]] so that the thinking accumulates.

[[Leaps of insight emerge from prior thought]]. So where does that thought happen? It could happen in your head, or in a series of fleeting sketches in the pages of your notebook, but [[Knowledge work should accrete]], and those mechanisms are awfully lossy.

Consider some hypothetical leap of insight you’d like to be able to make. To make that leap, you’ll typically need to evolve many independent, partially-formed ideas simultaneously, until they suddenly converge in a flash of inspiration. If you need to iterate on more than a few pieces at once, you may struggle to keep them all in your head.

By contrast, because [[Evergreen notes should be atomic]] they’re small enough in scope that you can start and finish one note in well under half an hour (see [[Evergreen notes permit smooth incremental progress in writing (“incremental writing”)]]). Yet each note you write represents an increment in your thinking about that specific idea, and each note enriches the broader network of links ([[Evergreen notes should be densely linked]]). Because these are [[Evergreen notes]], you now have a clear place to stand as you iterate on this specific idea.

The notes you write will interact with materials you read ([[Evergreen note-writing helps reading efforts accumulate]]) and will produce the foundations of new manuscripts ([[Executable strategy for writing]]).

And if you can’t write even one atomic note on the idea you have, [Spaced repetition may be a helpful tool to incrementally develop inklings](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zSK4LyrCbG9zDrdCWmcovUW).

> Naturally, independence presupposes a minimal measure of intrinsic complexity. The slip box needs a number of years in order to reach critical mass. Until then, it functions as a mere container from which we can retrieve what we put in. This changes with its growth in size and complexity. On the one hand, the number of approaches and occasions for questions increases. The slip box becomes a universal instrument.
