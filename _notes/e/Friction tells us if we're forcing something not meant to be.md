The old adage: "If it's meant to be it will be"

The level of thinking required for a decision should be proportional to the potential downside of that decision.

What someone does during the decision-making process is infinitely more important than the decision itself.

Be patience so your own judgement isn’t clouded and you get a glimpse into their modus operandi. How they see the world. And how it underpins their overall work. The more you wait, the more you learn about the opposition and if they are the right people to work with.

> A mismatch between the perceived risk (as reflected in the length of the decision-making process) and the actual risk, can indicate a deeper problem.

The bigger the mismatch the bigger the hidden risk or downside for you later.

If the risk is low but the decision is taking too long, this may reflect a deeper issue.

Likewise, if the risk is high and the decision is rushed this may reflect a deeper flaw like impulsivity.

A good question to ask in any sales conversation is:

> **What’s the most important decision you’ve made in the last 6 months?**

> **“I’ve been in the job for 12 months, what does success look like?”**

You’ll know straight away their view on risk and how they view the decision to be made.

**Continually lean back on the upside for you and if the downside has increased significantly past that upside due to the friction-consequence mismatch.**
