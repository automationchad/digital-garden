These thoughts are not seperated between positive and negative just attuned to your choosen state of being.

1. Chaotic repeating thoughts: nonsense, selfloathing, fear, worries, fragments, memories, impressions, basically everything scattered
2. Ordered repeating thoughts: focused thinking with aÂ goal in mind, concentrated work without an endpoint (yet), therefore still continual.
3. Insightful thoughts: that breaks a current cycle, and beginn a new one with different complexity, starting this process again.
4. Sexy thoughts
