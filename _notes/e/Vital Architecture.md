“Form follows function” has defined modern architecture. We traded [[the sublime]] for utility. We must recover it. 

The essence of architecture and city planning isn't in some spreadsheet of profit margins or the dull notion of "functional utility." It's about a grand vision and executing that vision in a way that leaves people awe-struck. They didn't just innovate with the arch and the dome for the hell of it; these were masterstrokes that merged form and function, allowing for richer artistic statements.

We were told that ornament must be stripped (especially by Rand). The aesthetic taste of Fitzgerald was the past, and Hemingway was the future. We were told that everything must serve a practical purpose, and we were told to discard the “trivial” beauty of the cathedral in favor of the utility of the Prius. 

But does beauty and ornament not serve a practical purpose? Applying sexual selection theory to architecture, we generate a theory of the utility of beauty — buildings must *attract* their inhabitants. Only when buildings become vital, attracting life — can they being to look towards something higher, and can serve the function of lifting our field of vision to the heavens. Technology will unlock a new renaissance in architecture — designed with the help of tools like [@midjourney](https://twitter.com/midjourney) , and physically shaped with the help of manufacturing methods.
