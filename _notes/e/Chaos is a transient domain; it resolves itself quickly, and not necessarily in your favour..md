Chaos is your house catching fire.

Chaos is accident and emergency.

Chaos is any situation in which value or opportunity is quickly being destroyed.

**It isnâ€™t safe for things to fail.**

(If it is safe for things to fail, the problem is [Complex](https://www.notion.so/Complex-54924df03a5d4d5785fb7831fdd1ee41?pvs=21) , not [Chaotic](https://www.notion.so/Chaotic-b619581fa760470aa639f706923fd17c?pvs=21))

Example here is a field change in Salesforceâ€™s API meaning that a clientsâ€™ critical Revenue automation is not running properly, theyâ€™re losing money, and you need to dropÂ _everything_Â and fix itÂ _now_.

OR someone deleted a field at 11:59pm the night before the go-live dateâ€¦

In chaos, you act.

You get out of the house.

You stem the bleeding.

You doÂ _something_Â to get the situation under better control.

Itâ€™s also the place of urgent opportunity, and with care it can be used to generate innovation and help with decision making but itâ€™s normally regarded as a really bad place to be.

A lot of the practices have come about because of previous accidents â€“ think of all the ways in which aircraft have changed, like oval windows instead of square ones, and inflatable slides that can be used as life rafts.

Something to also keep in mind is humans areÂ _definitely_Â uncomfortable with chaos, and often make the mistake of treating a one-off chaotic incident as systemic, stamping controls over everything when what we really need is a way of probing, or trying things out safely.

## How does Motis Group handle Chaotic problems?

The thought process here is act, sense, respond.

You act first to neutralize the threat, once itâ€™s neutralized you then can analyze the situation at hand and then make an educated decision of what to do to to avoid making the same mistake in the future.

Ideally, we donâ€™t entertain these types of problems with any net-new clients that arenâ€™t active managed service clients as theyâ€™ll likely just care about someone who can provide a quick fix vs. a long-term partner which goes against our core values.
