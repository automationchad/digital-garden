> Good wine needs no bush - William Shakespeare

When speaking publicly, researchers and entrepreneurs alike tend to present the rosiest possible picture of their work. This often leads to harmful over-claiming ([[Pitching out corrupts within]]) and a less personal, more transactional relationship with others. An interesting antidote is to actively practice “anti-marketing”: to make a point of focusing publicly on the _least_ rosy parts of one’s projects—what’s confusing, what’s frustrating, what’s not working.

If you make anti-marketing the goal, then interesting challenges become a positive thing: fodder for public conversation, not something to be swept under the rug. At least most of the time, you _should_ be focused on your project’s biggest challenges, rather than what’s going well. I suspect it also builds a deeper, more authentic relationship with one’s audience (see also [[Work with the garage door up]])

This term was coined (as far as I know!) by Michael Nielsen in November, 2019 (in personal conversation).
