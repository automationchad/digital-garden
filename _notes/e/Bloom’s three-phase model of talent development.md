[Benjamin S. Bloom](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z98ELwLd3gtzZxifJxoKzBH) (1985) characterizes three significant phases in youthful talent development:

1. The student is introduced to the activity in an enjoyable, often playful context. They might demonstrate “promise,” prompting their parents to suggest explicit instruction.
2. The student embarks on a deliberate program of improvement, engaging in instruction and practice
3. The student commits to full-time study of that activity, often attending a dedicated academy for that purpose. This phase culminates in the student making a living professionally.

Ericsson et al (1993) suggest a fourth phase: once the student’s a professional practitioner, they work to make unique contributions to that domain (i.e. to become an “eminent” performer).
