Life is about recognizing patterns.

It appears in history.

Our biases often mask it in our personal experiences.

The challenge lies in recognizing these patterns in real time.

Understanding the current pattern is essential.

So the ultimate goal in thought – to build a legacy – is to collect these patterns that allow you to decipher future patterns quickly and act accordingly.

If no pattern fits, rely on fundamental principles and sound judgment.
