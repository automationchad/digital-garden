**Make it easy for people to understand you.** Speak plainly. Ditch the jargon and communicate clearly. People shouldn't need a decoder ring to get what you're saying. ([[Internal reward comes from understanding the complexities, external reward comes from abstracting it to others.]])

**Make it easy for people to pay you.**  
Use straightforward payment options. No hidden fees, no complicated invoicing—just a direct, simple way for people to give you their money. Transparency in transactions builds trust.

**Place things where you first looked for them.** This is practical advice not just for you, but for creating a user-friendly environment. It's about intuitive design—making it easier for people to navigate spaces, physical or digital.

>If you’re looking for something and finally find it, when you’re done with it, don’t put it back where you found it. Put it where you first looked for it.

**Make it easy for people to like you.**  
Be approachable and kind. Listen more than you speak. It’s simple social dynamics: people like those who make them feel heard and valued.

**Make it easy.** This is your mantra. Life already throws enough challenges at people. Don't be another one. Make interactions with you smooth and painless.

Most people are inherently lazy. Or maybe it's more accurate to say they're efficient—they don't want to expend more energy than they have to (Contra: [[Overcomplicating and resistance]]).

This aligns well with the philosophy of [[Process over product]]. The way you do something often matters more than what you're actually doing. Make that process straightforward, and people are more likely to engage with the product, be it a service you’re offering or a relationship you’re building.
