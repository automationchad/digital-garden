When a scene “cuts” in a game, it feels like the director’s hand, not the player’s. It disrupts the continuity of cause and effect ([[Enacted experiences require participant-situated cause and effect]]).

Games like [[The Witness]], God of War (2018), and [[Journey]] (mostly) minimize the presence of the camera and avoid “cuts.” They’re more like movies that are “shot in one take.”
