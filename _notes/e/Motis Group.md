My platform for experiments in [[Conscious capitalism]], with [[A small ontological unit of experts in their respective fields is a good way to build a company|a small ontological unit of experts]], etc. [https://motis.group](https://motis.group)

An unorganized set of working notes on challenges which feel particularly salient (see [[Conscious capitalism]] for more):

- [[Estimation is evil]]
- [[Technical debt]]
- [[The main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing]]
- [[Metric fixation]]
- [[Building timelessly]] 
- [[Skills over process]]
- [[Process over product]]
