Our approach to invoicing and payments can be summed up as "Pay-to-Play with Incentives." We enforce strict rules for payment terms but offer flexibility and rewards for those who comply with or exceed these terms.

**Upfront Payments Required**: All of our invoicing and payment strategies are centered around not having to chase people down for money. For invoices of a certain amount and below, 100% of the payment is due in full before work begins. For invoices above that amount, we're willing to accept terms of 50% in advance and 50% after completion of work. In *every* case, regardless of how you split or don't split the invoice, there is money due in advance before you even begin the project.Â This ensures liquidity and operational viability.

**Unwavering Timelines**: We make it clear to companies that they are NOT on our schedule until they send payment. It doesn't matter how quickly they need the work or how fast of a turnaround time they're hoping for. Our terms don't change based on their timeline, ensuring that our time remains valuable.

**Deferred Collaboration**: A lot of companies have payment terms of 30, 60, or 90 days or insist on paying only by check. For such cases, we encourage them to go ahead and start the process and then we can work together when the check actually clears.Â . This deflects the need to chase payments and aligns with a lean operational model. In almost every case clients are able to figure out to pay their invoices sooner.Â 

**Payment Completes Publication**: For invoices that have been split into parts, the remaining part is due _after_ completion of work but _before_ work is published. In almost every case, clients are able to figure out how to pay their invoices sooner.

**Incentivized Compliance**: As another part of this, we offer incentives for brands who can pay quickly. If you can turn your invoice around in 24 hours, we'll knock off a percentage (like 5%). This rewards good financial behavior.

**No Second Chances on Incentives**: On the flip side, if you were offered an incentive and then failed to pay, that incentive expires after 30 days and it's not offered again.

**Priority Comes at a Premium**: If you need priority processing, it's available at 1.5x the hourly rate.

#### Alignments with Philosophical or Business Models

1. **Transactional Integrity**: Our approach is a strict form of Transactional Integrity. Each interaction is a transaction that must be pre-qualified by payment.
2. **Skin in the Game**: This aligns with Nassim Taleb's concept, ensuring that clients are committed from the get-go.
3. **Behavioral Economics**: Our use of incentives taps into principles of behavioral economics, leveraging human tendencies for immediate rewards.
