Pay upfront or don't play. 

Money down before we even start, no exceptions. 

For small invoices, pay 100% upfront; for bigger ones, it's 50% before and 50% after work. Keeps us liquid, keeps us working.

You're not on our calendar until we see the cash. Don't care about your tight deadlines; our time is valuable.

Don't like upfront payments? Wait until your check clears, then we talk. Most clients sort their payments out sooner rather than waiting.

Work's done, but you won't see it until you settle the balance.

Pay fast, get a discount. Turn around an invoice in 24 hours, you save 5%. 

Miss the incentive? It's gone in 30 days and won't return.

Need priority? That'll be 1.5x the rate.

3. Behavioral Economics: Fast payment gets rewarded, leverages basic human instinct for quick gains.
