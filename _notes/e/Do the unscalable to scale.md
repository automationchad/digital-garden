A strategic career trajectory often starts by engaging in tasks that, although labor-intensive, offer a guaranteed income. Subsequently, one could transition to scalable but riskier ventures that don't necessarily promise steady earnings. For instance, someone could initiate their journey as a Junior Copywriter with a team that excels in affiliate marketing. After gaining hands-on experience, they could venture into affiliate marketing themselves. The next leap could be running their own offers. Each stage inherently involves an increase in scalability, risk, and skill level requirements.

Another track could be in sales, starting as a Sales Development Representative (SDR) and ascending to an Account Executive (AE). After proving oneself as a top performer, consulting on the side for small businesses or startups by setting up effective lead generation systems is a natural next step. This consulting role could either evolve into a full-time job or remain a side hustle. The ultimate stage could involve acquiring a small business in one's industry and scaling it using tested sales processes.
