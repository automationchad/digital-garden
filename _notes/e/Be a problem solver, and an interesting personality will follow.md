I don't enjoy meeting new people—simple as that. It's not a social aversion; it's an energy calculation. Most people aren't worth the effort because they're not problem solvers, they're consumers.

See, there's a chasm between the two: problem solvers dissect issues, entertain multiple hypotheses, and genuinely seek diverse input. Consumers? They're just regurgitating what they've heard or liked, operating at a headline-level depth. The devil makes use of idle hands. [[Culturally default behaviors fill spare time with others’ ideas]]. Waste of time. Why Google something when you can ask a consumer and get the same low-resolution answer?

Here's how to not waste time: apply a filter, a robust one. A friend asked asked how I network. I was blunt. "Only losers go to networking events." It's an inefficient market. You pay a few bucks to meet people who mostly just need something from you. If you're interesting, accomplished, and on the up, people will seek you out (See: [[Preselection creates opportunities]]). And if they don't, you're doing something wrong.

Keep grinding, or you'll fade. Interesting isn't a state; it's a stage (See: [[States vs. Stages]]). Think Steve Case, AOL founder. Still relevant because he didn't stop.

The people worth meeting are also meeting people worth meeting. You benefit, they benefit—it's a reciprocal, ongoing relationship of problem-solving and value creation. No need for facades or games; just be honest, direct, and accomplished. Like attracts like.

Lastly, exclusive groups with paywalls can help, but they're not the endgame. They filter out some noise but also introduce their own issues—like sociopaths leveraging social accreditations (See: [[§Cult psychology]]). Use them wisely, or not at all.

Bottom line: Be a problem solver. Look for depth, complexity, and genuine innovation. That's how you meet people worth meeting and live a life worth living. No bullshit.
