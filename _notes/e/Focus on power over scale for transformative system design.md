There’s an analogue to [[Gall’s law]] in system design: if you want a transformatively powerful system (e.g. [[Tools for thought]]) that applies in many contexts for many people, you probably need to evolve it from a system which had truly transformative power in some narrow context.

A system which seems only modestly powerful—no matter how broadly applicable—probably can’t be evolved in-place into something transformative. The primitive abstraction will need to change. It’ll be easier to figure out how to do that with a highly focused context of use ([[Effective system design requires insights drawn from serious contexts of use]]), and much harder if you’ve prematurely scaled ([[Premature scaling can stunt system iteration]]).

Pervasive norms in the tech industry seem to oppose this principle ([[Tech industry culture rarely produces transformative tools for thought]]). If you’ve got something that shows promise in some narrow context, the strong cultural impulse is to scale that to as many people/contexts as possible. The opposing impulse would be: no, linger in that space; keep pushing on the primitives; [[A small ontological unit of experts in their respective fields is a good way to build a company]], make the system as utterly transformative as possible for some small group of people. Once it’s life-changing, figure out how it might apply to more people or contexts.
