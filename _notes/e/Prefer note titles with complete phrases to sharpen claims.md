When writing [[Evergreen notes]] I’ve found that using complete phrases as note titles helps maintain concept-orientation ([Evergreen notes should be concept-oriented](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z2hQEhqWkdRLL9JUwfawZZx)). For example: [Educational objectives often subvert themselves](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z2pjEUvJy7Ge6yDaBo66zEu), [Evergreen notes permit smooth incremental progress in writing (“incremental writing”)](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zNqLdKMiTo9EHA9EWYGXs7b).

These are often declarative or imperative phrases making a strong claim. This puts pressure on me to adequately support the claim in the body. If I write a note but struggle to summarize it in a sharp title, that’s often a sign that my thinking is muddy or that this note is about several topics (contra [Evergreen notes should be atomic](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zNUaiGAXp21eorsER1Jm9yU)). In both cases, the solution is to break the ideas down and write about the bits I understand best first.

Questions also make good note titles because that position creates pressure to make the question get to the core of the matter. Some questions really are evergreen ([To what extent is exceptional ability heritable?](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z3CX38AdFzNGcujEwctVj5X)); others are more ephemeral creative prompts ([How might the mnemonic medium enable readers in genres outside platform knowledge?](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z6eSdsLVZLGWuR7m3WQGgAY)). The goal with the latter type of note is to eventually drop the question mark, refactoring it into declarative/imperative notes.

A few common exceptions to this policy:

- I use nouns and noun phrases in note titles only to define core terms (which other notes generally orbit around). Examples: [Executable strategy](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zVyJffuisLSjaDVtBtxsmSS), [Enacted experience](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z92TGMiBsnraf5KXxSTNkBJ), [Enabling environment](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z492hGrHvRvJiEY9UfB4Mby)
- Outline notes (see [Create speculative outlines while you write](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z79rMNNuLrUj6R8q1CXSpDm)) like [§Note-writing systems](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zEZi3ytBhZHHweRYNAosQ1g)

I often begin by writing a note without knowing what the title will be. The title often emerges from the text as it’s written. When a note suggests a strong title with a clear claim, that’s a good sign that it’s starting to make sense. Related: [[Evergreen note titles are like APIs]]
