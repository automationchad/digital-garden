Unlike women, men love idealistically. To a man, love is a principle that is greater than himself.  Men don't use love as a survival tactic, like women do. Men latch onto a belief that his love was special, and meant to be. Thus, men take longer to get over heartbreak.

In the realm of human connections, men often find themselves ensnared by an idealistic version of love. For them, love isn't a mere emotion; it stands as a grand principle, transcending them. Men don't use love as a survival tactic, like women do. Consequently, when heartbreak strikes, men grapple with it longer, anchored by the belief that their love was predestined.

One common pitfall? The illusion of uniqueness. Many mistakenly pedestalize their former partners, imagining them to be irreplaceably special. This is often a mirage, an overestimation magnified by emotional voids and the mind's tendency to gloss over flaws. A mental trap, where the allure isn't the individual but the whirlwind of emotions they induce.

The truth is, while these emotions seem tied to one person, they're universal feelings that can be replicated in other relationships. The enchantment isn't necessarily in the person but in the dreams and fantasies projected onto them.

[[Perfect for you is recognising no one is perfect]]

To move on, it’s crucial to recognize this illusion and seek more fulfilling, genuine connections. The path forward is not in reminiscing about the past but investing in oneself. Personal growth, in solitude and self-reflection, paves the way. The aim? Not to find another, but to find oneself.

As Michael Linowitz once eloquently expressed:

> “_There are so many beautiful, complex people here, that are begging to be discovered…why would you still be worrying about some trick at home?_” – Michael Linowitz

Life's essence is impermanence. People enter and exit our lives, but self-worth remains constant. Embrace the present, cherish the lessons, and foster an open heart, even amidst pain. Let go of the past and invest that love back into oneself. The journey of healing isn't about reclaiming the past but about reshaping the future with renewed wisdom.
