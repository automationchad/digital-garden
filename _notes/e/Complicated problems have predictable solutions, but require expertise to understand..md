A watch is complicated.

Cars are complicated.

A lot of mechanical things end up in the complicated domain.

An expert can take them apart and put them back together again; they’re made up of the sum of their parts.

They have well-understood purposes and outcomes, but an untrained person without expertise will not be able to solve the problem.

A good gauge for this is:

> “Could Huni solve this problem for the prospect WITHOUT asking Will?”

If the answer is “No”, then it’s a complicated problem.

Problems in this domain usually have more than one way of being solved, so there are multiple good practices.

A lot of software development is complicated.

Example here is [NovaHQ](https://novahq.com) where the requirements were pretty cut and dry BUT needed Will’s expertise to build.

> “We need these 2 softwares connected based on this business process and that business process is not going to change”.

## How does Motis Group handle Complicated problems?

In a complicated environment, the thought process is sense, analyse and respond.

You say, “Let me **have a look** at this problem, **think it through** and I’ll **tell you how to solve it**, because I’m an expert at this.”

We’re able to set out to achieve some project, gather the requirements, chunk the project down into smaller components, build it, test it and say, “Job done.”
