I’ve noticed that my world tends to become richer and more colorful when I express wariness of “should” impulses that arise within me. By this I mean urges which spring from a sense of duty or obligation. I “should” clean up the house; I “should” do something useful with my afternoon even though I don’t feel like working; etc.

Very concretely, I’ve had a lot of (spiritual/emotional) success spending at least one day each weekend doing my best to ignore those urges, just doing whatever seems pleasurable and committing to nothing.

This is of course not a unique idea. See e.g.:

> You can almost always re-state a should-sentence without the should. … “I should call my father this week” might cash out to “if I don’t call my father this week, he’ll feel disappointed and lonely.” “I shouldn’t play that video game” might cash out to “if I play that video game, I’ll lose lots of time that I was planning to use for studying.

Shoulds are for retrospectives, not for deliberation.

Guilt is just herd anxiety.

> A few months ago, a friend of mine was describing her motivational issues to me. As an example, she explained she was having trouble making herself clean her room, despite her dissatisfaction with the constant messiness.
> 
> I asked: "Have you considered just not forcing yourself?"
> 
> She blinked, and cocked her head at me, and said "but then my room wouldn't get cleaned."
> 
> I called bullshit. Because look: either (a) you stop forcing yourself to clean the room, and you realize you don't actually care about having a clean room, and then your room stays messy _and that's fine because you don't care_; or (b) you stop forcing yourself to clean the room, and then you get a bit worried, because some part of you _actually wants the room cleaned_, so you listen to that part of yourself, and you work with it, and you find a time to clean the room _because you want to._
