If we’re reading a web page and notice that it relates to some PDF on our hard drive, we have no real way to make that association. But we _can_ create a note which links to both resources.

This is different from the memex solution (Bush, 1945), which imagined direct linkages between documents of any kind—yours or others’.

Writing a note is good because it forces you to [[Do your own thinking]], but it’s a bit heavy because [[Evergreen notes should be concept-oriented]]. So to write the note, we have to extract the conceptual link between the two, name it, and arrange it in some way that might attract future linkages.

When we [[Write about what you read to internalize texts deeply]], we have two layers of notes: there are lightweight notes about the reading itself in our reference library, then there are higher-fidelity [[Evergreen notes]]) in our note archive. It may be valuable to support two layers of noting about association fidelity as well: one could make lightweight associations between materials, then encode the valuable observations into durable notes over time.
