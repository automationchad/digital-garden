Norms aren't universal truths; they're societal constructs. This absence of objective morality is precisely why we need governance. If morality were as clear-cut as the sun's existence, we'd all nod in agreement. But the rules we live by are more malleable, shaped by collective egos that refuse to admit their subjectivity. Take any moral debate, from sexuality to capital punishment. People want their views not just accepted but canonized, as if etched in stone.

Political norms are just as fluid, governed by the Overton windowâ€”the range of ideas society is willing to entertain at a given time. What was once considered far-left or far-right can become mainstream as this window shifts. It's not a static frame but a dynamic boundary that evolves with societal values.

Judging past societies by modern standards is naive. Slavery wasn't always viewed as abhorrent; the idea that it was immoral had to be cultivated and disseminated. We stand on the shoulders of those who shifted the Overton window, and it's not for us to retroactively impose our evolved norms on them. Likewise, judging less developed cultures through the lens of Western values ignores the environmental and socio-political factors that make governance a unique challenge in each locale.

Let's also dismantle the notion that past societies were idyllic or that we can revert to some golden age. Change is the only constant. New technologies don't just offer new gadgets; they necessitate systemic shifts in how we live and govern. That requires a populace capable of systemic thinking. Don't confuse this with electing a so-called 'systems thinker.' The average voter must first appreciate the nuances of systemic issues to cast an informed ballot.

And let's be clear: balance isn't always about finding a middle ground. There are issues where compromise isn't just inappropriate; it's detrimental. Slavery isn't a debate to be 'balanced' with pro and anti viewpoints. Some norms shift because society reaches a consensus that certain practices are intolerable. In a world devoid of objective morality, that collective decision-making is the closest we come to defining right and wrong.
