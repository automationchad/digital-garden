front doors are the standard, open-to-all pathways that offer a sense of security but often come with queues and tedious processes.

This might include attending college right after high school, pursuing a particular career because it's deemed stable, or any other "default" life choices.

The front door is obvious. Everyone sees it. It's the easiest to go to. But you have to wait in line. You can cut the line by paying or knowing someone but it comes at a cost -- you have to tip off the bouncer or have 7 supermodels with you. It's a trade off, do you work hard and secure something through the [[The backdoor]] or do you forgo that and expedite it with money through the front door?
