Society lures us with passive income, painting it as the ultimate dream. But let's be blunt: it's a myth. There's no 'passive fitness', is there? 

True income isn't passive; itâ€™s earned. If you think you can sit back and watch wealth grow, you're a central banker. You're a scourge of the earth. You're a usurer. You're misled. You contradict nature's law.

Businesses and products, however, are real. They have form, substance, and purpose. When an entrepreneur crafts a business, they create tangible value. 

Whether it's automating processes or crafting unique travel experiences, the satisfaction from these creations dwarfs any financial gain.

Take Mario, the Italian hotelier. Not a billionaire lounging on a yacht, but rich in real terms. Money is no object for him. Wealth for him isnâ€™t in paper, but in relationships and the joy of creation. Heâ€™s hands-on, creating active value. Thatâ€™s genuine wealth and a life truly lived.
