"PASSIVE INCOME" is the industry's biggest sleight of hand. Beginners swallow this bait whole because, let's face it, it's an enticing sell.

Let's cut through the crap. The rare individuals who manage to set up a so-called "passive income" have bled and sweat for YEARS to amass a specific skill set. 

And here's a newsflash: it's not even truly "passive". A more honest label? "Delayed payment income". 

Why? Because you're busting your ass now for a potential pay-off later.

"Oh, but real estate is passive, right?" Bullshit. 

For a newbie, real estate is a treacherous path. You're better off taking that cash you're sinking into bricks and mortar for a measly $1,000/mo and invest in an online venture, plus get an OBM to manage it. The outcome? Easily pocketing $5k monthly instead of a pathetic $500.

Bottom line: If you're dreaming of "passive income", get ready to first master your game for the next 3-4 years. Only then can you even think about reaping rewards without the daily grind.
