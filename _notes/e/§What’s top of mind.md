title: §What’s top of mind
---
Sort of like a [/now page](https://sivers.org/nowff), but with a broader time horizon and focused on what I’m thinking about.

- Expanding and understanding [[§Conscious capitalism]] via [[Motis Group]]
- Bodysurfing and taking in [[the sublime]]
- Investing in creating unique travel experiences at [[Maelstrom Holdings]]
- Researching and ultimately fighting against [[§Cult psychology]]
- Using [[music]] as my artistic outlet under the pseudonym [Sevirance](https://soundcloud.com/sevirance)
