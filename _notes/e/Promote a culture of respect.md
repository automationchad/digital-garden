Don't tolerate disrespect. Thoughts from Marco Pierre White.

Interviewer: You kicked out 8 people in the last two weeks. Why did you do it?

Marco: 

> "Well basically I'm here 18 hours a day, 6 days a week, this is like my house, this is like my home. When I cook every night, it's cooking for people who hopefully are appreciative, and as I say 90-95% are very appreciative. But you've got that other 5% who are incredibly rude, obnoxious, they click their fingers, they arrive late, and I don't want those people in my house. If I came to your house for a dinner party and I was obnoxious, I was rude, I was late,  are you going to tolerate me? No. You're going to ask me to leave aren't you? But just because they're paying for it they think rude and obnoxious. Well in Harvey's they don't get a bill, we just ask them to leave, we don't want their money.
