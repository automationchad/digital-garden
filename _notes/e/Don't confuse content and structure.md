Getting lost in the sauce.

[[What is the notion of going meta?]]? Going meta means that you're stepping outside of the plane of the content.

[[Form versus function]]

[[The map is not the territory]]

**Content makes things real.** **Structure gets to the processes by which we make things real**.

What is structure? What is content? What is their relationship?

DVD Disc = Structure
Data encode on disc = content

What are the main structures that are dictating my life? 

What structures am I not aware or? Which would I like to change and how?

Where am I lost in content, when structure is the true cause?

Another excercise I think could be interesting:

take one problem in your life, and try to analyse it not at the cause-effect small picture content level, but try to go meta on it:

See: [[Levels of magnification]]

- Where have I encountered a similar problem before?

- What are the hidden assumptions and rules dictating that situation?

- Could it be the way that the structure is set up that is causing the problem, instead of an isolated action or incidence within it?

- What structures are even in play in this scenario?
