Researchers and technologists looking to apply computational power as tools often approach the problem from one of two distinct perspectives: augmenting the abilities of a human operator (“intelligence augmentation”), or developing methods which automate human operations (“artificial intelligence”). Some tasks are particularly well suited to the latter (e.g. [[ML is good at making tedious tasks “free”]]); at least for now, more creative tasks are typically better addressed by “IA”-inspired techniques.

## Examples of IA

- computational photography
- [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z2D1qPwddPktBjpNuwYFVva)
- search engine autocomplete (via Heer, 2019)

A 2023 MS presentation framed this as “Copilot vs autopilot”—that’s nice.
