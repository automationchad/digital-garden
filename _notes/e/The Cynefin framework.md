The Cynefin framework was developed by Dave Snowden and some of his colleagues to describe different types of problems.

It introduces four domains – obvious, complicated, complex and chaotic – and a fifth domain in the centre, disorder, for when it’s unclear which type of problem we’re dealing with (and we all have a preferred domain whose practices we fall back into).

There’s also a line between the “obvious” to “chaotic” boundary, to show how easily obvious solutions can cause complacency OR entrained thinking and tip into chaos.

For instance, replacing outdated office equipment might be an [[Obvious problems are ones that either children can solve, or, if they do require expertise, the solution is obvious.]] domain.

Coding a data pipeline that transfers data between a databases might fall into the [[Complicated problems have predictable solutions, but require expertise to understand.]] domain.

Developing a new product for a market the company has never served before could fall into the [[Acting in the space causes the space to change, and cause and effect can only be understood in retrospect]] domain.

Managing a sudden crisis, such as a major product recall or PR disaster, might fall into the [[Chaos is a transient domain; it resolves itself quickly, and not necessarily in your favour.]] domain.

All of these problem types require different approaches to solve.

Incorrectly identifying a problem type and acting on it will make things fall into the [[Disorder is the domain in which we don’t know which of the domains dominate, so we behave according to our preferred domain.]] domain.

To solve for this and de-risk misinterpreting a problem type in discovery we can ask:

“_**Who’s done this before?**_”

Q: "We all know how to do this"
A: [[Obvious problems are ones that either children can solve, or, if they do require expertise, the solution is obvious.]]

Q: "Someone in our team has done this"
A: [[Complicated problems have predictable solutions, but require expertise to understand.]]

Q: “Someone in our organization has done this OR we have access to expertise some other way like Motis Group”
A: [[Complicated problems have predictable solutions, but require expertise to understand.]]

Q: “Someone’s done this, but not in this context; don’t know what they discovered, or if it’ll be viable for us to replicate it”
A: [[Acting in the space causes the space to change, and cause and effect can only be understood in retrospect]]

Q: “Nobody’s done this before; it might not work at all”
A: [[Acting in the space causes the space to change, and cause and effect can only be understood in retrospect]], [[Chaos is a transient domain; it resolves itself quickly, and not necessarily in your favour.]]
