The idea that you can learn from your emotions by understanding how to identify them and deciphering what they are telling you.

Emotions control your behavior. Your behavior determines your success and happiness. In the end, what you're after is a certain set of positive emotions (to be happy) and avoiding certain negative emotions.

Understanding emotions will help you understand and interact with people.

We are all driven by 4 core desires:

- Desire for control
- Desire for security
- Desire for approval
- Desire for uniqueness and/or oneness

All emotions fall into the following basic categories: apathy, grief, fear, lust, anger, pride, courage, acceptance, peace.

Thoughts >> Emotions >> Actions

What your negative emotions mean:

- Discomfort: Something isn't quite right. Get clear about what you want and try something new.
- Fear: Anticipation that something bad might happen. Need to prepare.
- Hurt: Sense of loss. Realize that really nothing has been lost, or talk it out.
- Anger: A boundary has been violated. Realize that your rule isn't necessarily the absolute rule. Communicate your rules more clearly.
- Frustration: You could be doing better than you currently are. Find a better way.
- Disappointment: An expectation of yours isn't likely to get met. Set a new, empowering goal.
- Guilt: You have violated your own standard. Commit to never violating this standard again.
- Inadequacy: You don't currently have the skills or knowledge that you need. Commit to learning and improving.
- Overwhelm: You are overcommitted. Need to reevaluate your priorities and take a baby step.
- Loneliness: You desire to reach out and connect with someone. Need to create a connection.

Catalyst emotions vs negative meotions. Frustration vs anger. Depress vs sadness. Catalyst emotions are designed to be transient. They bring about change which subsequently removes them.
