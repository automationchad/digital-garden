When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.

> All metrics of scientific evaluation are bound to be abused. Goodhart's law [...] states that when a feature of the economy is picked as an indicator of the economy, then it inexorably ceases to function as that indicator because people start to game it. — Mario Biagioli

The economy can be likened to ourselves, and as soon as we over-optimise around a metric, be it productivity or savings in our bank account, we cease to actually be useful.

Never letting metrics, numbers, scale or bean-counters get in the way of what makes our business special: the speed of iteration, innovation, and at all times, being intimate with the customer and our people.
