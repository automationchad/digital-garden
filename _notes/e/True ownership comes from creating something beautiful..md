Power.

Grandeur.

Vision.

These were the virtues etched in the hearts of the ancient Romans.

They didn't concern themselves with petty calculations of profit and loss; instead, they embraced the boundless aspiration of the human spirit.

Monumental edifices were erected not merely as ostentatious displays of wealth, but as testaments to the might and glory of their civilization.

Their prowess was demonstrated not through mundane commercial arithmetic, but through the exquisite artistry of their buildings, statues, baths, and roads.

In an epoch when most of the world remained primitive, these audacious Romans engineered infrastructure marvels: running water, functional toilets, and heat-based spas.

They brought luxuries, typically reserved for the elite, to the masses, not driven by profit, but because they could.

This was a tangible manifestation of their conviction that a united society, in pursuit of a grand vision, could transcend the ordinary, the mundane, and the profit-driven.

Rome was their canvas, and they painted a cityscape that was more than just functionalâ€”it was aesthetically pleasing, a testament to the human potential for greatness.

The city was designed for its people, with public spaces and structures that encouraged perambulation and exploration.

Landmarks such as the Vatican and the Colosseum were more than just buildings; they were symbols of Roman grandeur and ambition, intuitively placed to be discovered without the need for maps or guides.

The urban planning of ancient Rome bore testament to their belief in shared vision's power and aesthetics' significance in human life.

The Romans grasped that a city is more than a place to liveâ€”it's a declaration of a society's values and aspirations.

This legacy of the Romans reverberates through time, their architectural wonders continuing to shape modern Europe's face.

Their example teaches us that true greatness isn't measured in profits, but in the boldness of our vision, the beauty of our creations and the power of place.
