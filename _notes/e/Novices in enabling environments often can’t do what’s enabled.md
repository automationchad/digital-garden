New participants in an [[Enabling environment]] may not immediately be able to do what it enables. The typical solution is an abstract introductory experience: explanatory guides, onboarding classes, background readings, etc. These supports can help new participants eventually access what an environment enables, but they’re not ideal: [[Enabling environments focus on doing what’s enabled]].
