Q: How do you make connections with people whose time is valuable?

A: 
1. By clearly articulating your ability.
2. By clearly articulating their upside.

More attention on their work? **Upside**  
Doing something you saw them ask for? **Upside**.  
Building them a tool that saves them time? **Upside**  
Introducing them to someone that can help them? **Upside**  
Showing them a specific untapped opportunity? **Upside**

The most common mistake here is to ask for permission to do the thing before you do it. In that scenario, you're making someone work for you, not the other way around. See: [[Make it easy for people to interact with you]].

1. Whatever it is you’re proposing you do, it adds value to you first. It becomes an asset you can leverage. 

2. Very few people will give you permission to do something when they have no idea who you are or what you're capable of.

**So just do it, and show them.**

Even if they don't see it, here's what happens:

- You force yourself to think
- You force yourself to solve problems
- You force yourself to publish
- You force yourself to improve
- You force yourself to build a portfolio of work
- Now you have a way to communicate your assets in your next pitch
