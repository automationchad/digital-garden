Humanity’s problem today is that we have Paleolithic emotions, medieval institutions, and god-like technology; our biology, civilization and technological capabilities are completely out of sync. We are living in a [[New Dark Age]].

How do we balance them?

- Look to nature
	- Look to natural systems as models. Nature, through billions of years of evolution, offers solutions that are sustainable and balanced.
	- [[§Emotions]]: Understand our evolutionary psychology. We have a technology that was refined over 2 million years. 
	- [[⎈Technology]]: Promote technological literacy. 

- Seek to uplift consciousness
	- Develop and adopt technologies that address human well-being, emphasizing tools that improve mental health, foster community, and bridge divides.
	- [[Don't make money at the expense of others, make money at the service of others]]
	- [[Guild learning]]

- Understand history and philosophy:
	- Encourage ethics in innovation. Ensure developers consider potential societal impacts of their creations.

- Institutional Reform:
	- Modernize legal, political, and social institutions to be more agile. Encourage decentralized decision-making. 

- **Cross-disciplinary Collaboration**:
    - Foster collaboration between technologists, social scientists, psychologists, and policymakers. Interdisciplinary teams can holistically address the juxtaposition of our emotions, institutions, and technologies.
