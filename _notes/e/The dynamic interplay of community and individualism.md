We often pit community and individualism against each other as if they're mortal enemies, but that's far too simplistic. Sure, individualism has its merits, but so does communityâ€”not just for pragmatic reasons like shared resources or collective decision-making. We're wired to be part of something larger than ourselves. It gives us purpose, a sense of belonging. The trick is to strike a nuanced balance between the two, a balance that isn't static but changes over time and context.

### Societal Holons: Nested Layers of Complexity

Think of society as a "holon," a structure that's both a whole and a part of a larger whole. It's like how a hand is part of a body but also consists of cells, each with its own autonomous functions yet interdependent on the larger system. Humans themselves are societal holons. We're individual units, sure, but we're also part of complex social structures.

### The Emergence of Collective Properties

There's a tendency to focus on the individual as the basic unit of society, but that's a bit reductionist. Groups of humans have emergent properties that can't be boiled down to simple individual actions. It's not just about managing people; it's about understanding the dynamics of groups, subgroups, and yes, the collective ego. Oh, and society as a whole is one massive collective ego. The complexity here is staggering, and traditional political analyses barely scratch the surface.

### Humanity's Recursive Arc: Division and Unity

Reality seems to have this habit of dividing itself only to find innovative ways to come back together. Human history is no exception. We likely started as a unified group in Africa, then dispersed into tribes and nations. These tribes clashed and blended, and now we're grappling with our identity as a global species. Denying this global identity is a path to conflict. The more harmonious route? Unification. That is until we colonize other planets, divide again, and the cycle of division and unity repeats.

### Long Arcs and Big Pictures

When you zoom out and look at the long arc of human history, some patterns start to emerge. There's a general trend toward more equality, higher levels of consciousness, and less brutality. We also see increasing complexity, greater freedoms, and ultimately, a move toward unity. It's a bumpy, non-linear journey, but the trajectory, on the whole, seems clear.
