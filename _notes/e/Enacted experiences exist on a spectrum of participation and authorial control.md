Any given [[Enacted experience]] can involve a wide range of participation and authorial control.

For example:

- you might hit play on Spotify and feel an emotion intended by a song’s artist (probably shy of an enacted experience—you likely don’t quite feel you brought that feeling about)
- you might play the same song on Guitar Hero and feel an intended emotion as you crescendo into the chorus (by contrast, this probably _does_ feel like you brought it about)
- you might perform the song from sheet music and feel an intended emotion as you crescendo in the chorus (stronger feeling that you brought it about, somewhat less authorial control)
- you might be caused to _compose_ a particular emotional quality into the song in a recording session facilitated by a crafty record producer
