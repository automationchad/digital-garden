Middle management often adds little to no value to a company's output, apart from providing unnecessary context to already available information. 

Management’s job is the same as the individual contributor - just at scale. 

Management’s role should be to step aside and focus on creating systems and processes that enable an individual contributor to flourish more than they are in the current work environment. 

If individuals are trained correctly, given adequate resources, and trusted to make decisions and take risks, there is no need for the "glorified babysitting". 

Individuals should have a bias towards action and do what they consider necessary for the business to succeed, without being prompted by external forces. 

If someone doesn’t align with this, then they have a right to walk out of the door and we have full right to kick them out.
