General tenets:

- 1 gram protein per pound bodyweight MANDATORY (unless you’re over 230 lbs, it can cap there), ideally 60% minimum from animal proteins. If trying to lose weight, eat protein first. If trying to gain, eat last. Protein is main factor in satiation.

- Quality of food source very important - shop local, seasonal, organic, homegrown. Maximize nutrient density from soil, minimize mass scale agricultural pesticides

- Eat real unprocessed foods only (higher thermogenic effect from eating them, note the things to AVOID).

- Caloric deficit created by activity levels, not just eating less (ex: eating 3k calories and burning 3500 via muscle mass + activity way more sustainable than eating 1800 calories + burning 2300 via minimal activity and base metabolic rate aka what you burn just by existing)

- Set up a Daily/ Weekly routine for your diet given these frameworks with a rough estimate of caloric & macronutrient intake needed to hit body composition goal in mind ([freedieting.com](http://freedieting.com/) great resource)

- You probably want to add in micronutrients via diet/supplements: See [[general supplement stack]]
