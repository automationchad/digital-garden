>"Technology democratizes consumption but consolidates production. The best in person in the world at anything, gets to do it for everyone." â€” Naval Ravikant

Technology has created a [[Disintermediation]] of labor. Availability of your energy and skills are no longer constrained by a middleman (employer or agency).

Much like blockchain aims towards decentrilization of a network, we as humans have become decentralized.

Because software is a contained system and we as humans are contained systems, there are a lot of parallels to what makes useful software and what makes useful human beings.

There are two components to a system:

1. Functional requirements that defineÂ _what_Â a system is supposed to do.
2. Non-functional requirements that defineÂ **how**Â the system should do it.

### **Functional requirements**Â 

These are the surface level things: your skills, abilities, and practical experience. This is your persona ([[Persona capitalizes on opportunities]]). 

Note: It needs to be well defined, and its something that we consistently like to get cute with ([[Resistance]]).

You want a clear offering and a clear workflow. 

This will lead to easy marketing. ([[Non-coercive marketing; Anti-marketing]], [[Preselection creates opportunities]])

This will lead into an intuitive UX layout ([[Make it intuitive]]). 

>When coming to your businesses, where does someone naturally first look for a piece of information? Put it there.

### **Non functional requirements** 

Think of these as how reliable are you at delivering your abilities. These are harder to see on the surface ([[Lagging indicators]]) but over the long term determine product stickiness ([[Personality maintains opportunities]]).

Using the SaaS dimension:

- If your product is consistently experiencing downtime because the overall scalability is crap, customers will churn. 
- If the UI is not intuitive it slows people down, customers will churn.

With these things in mind, you are like an API in the network.

Your talent, perspective and unique output as a plug-and-play accelerant for another person, business or idea.

Q: **How important are non-functional requirements really?** Reason I ask that is because they're are plenty of examples where people have focused on the functional requirements and have been successful.

A: I would first challenge your assumption of what success means. Is success rising to stardom really quickly to only then burn out after a couple of years? For me no. For me success means walking the path of the master. So the question becomes: How do you sustain the success? The only way to sustain the functional requirements is making sure that the software's built on top of a solid foundation of non-functional requirements.
