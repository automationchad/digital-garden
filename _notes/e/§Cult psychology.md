**What is a cult?**

A hierarchical organisation created by a charismatic narcissist leader, which uses mind control techniques to amass money, power and sex.

[[Cults In Our Midst - Margaret Thaler Singer]]


Hierarchical structure — pyramid scheme.

Started by a [[zen devil]].

The cost of membership is the work you go through when you actually do a deal with someone. It’s your time.

A scam has to be: 
1. charismatic enough, that it attracts prey. 
2. It has to be convincing enough that the prey attempts it. 
3. It has to have the perpetual hanging carrot on the stick, so that the prey is under illusion of that dream that is "by inches unachievable goal".

**Key words:** 

> Mind viruses; grifter;

It's not that the groups themselves are inherently bad, it's how they create mind-viruses.

**Why am I so passionate about researching this?**

Young men want to provide, earn respect, wield power, climb the social ladder, and enjoy a fulfilling sex life. Nothing wrong with that; it's about becoming the best version of yourself. The issue? When these ambitions get co-opted by charlatans who claim they can hand you all of this on a platter. That's nonsense. Authentic transformation comes from within, not from some external guru.

Why do we buy into these snake oil salesmen? Well, the world's a mess, leaving many young men disillusioned and questioning their identity and principles. It's all too easy to fall into a state of nihilism or adopt a defeatist mindset. Add to that a lack of genuine masculine role models, and you've got fertile ground for guru worship. That's when the real problems kick in: you become susceptible to manipulation and halt your own personal development.

I'm on a mission to keep others, particularly guys like me, from tumbling down this rabbit hole of deceit. Part of me is pissed off at the fraudsters running these schemes. But I also understand they're acting out of their own ego and immaturity. By dissecting this, I aim to guide others toward genuine maturity. And if they can't find it, then damn well help them create it themselves—become the change they're so desperate to see.
