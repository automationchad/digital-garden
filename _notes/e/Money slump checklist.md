If you're not making enough money, â€œ_WORKING MORE HOURS_" doing the same thing isn't going to fix anything. Instead, step back, think about a few things:

- [ ] Is there a way to also get paid for your results (not just time)?

- [ ] How are the tasks youâ€™re doing now acting as building blocks for the future? (If you're doing the same tasks as last year, you've made 0 progress)

- [ ] Where do you need to take a big leap and get messy? Feeling uncomfortable is the first step to more money.
