Technical debt is a term used in software development that can also be applied to our actions. When we make a decision, we take a step in a given direction. What do we take with us into that decision if not our skillset at the time and accountability, i.e., recognizing the consequences now and if they have happened?

Tech debt is cumulative so the more tech debt the more impact youâ€™re gonna see on how the various parts of your business operate or cease to operate.



How much technical debt are you keeping in your brain? How much baggage are you dealing with?

**Prudent and deliberate:** Action is deliberately made with an awareness of consequences. You have the skills, understand the risks, the stakes are relatively low, and the benefits of a quick delivery outweigh the risk.

> The decision is made after analyzing all the consequences. In this type of technical debt, the team analyses the risk and creates a plan of action to carefully and effectively handle the consequences of the tech debt, reducing the harm to a minimum. They also define a plan to pay off the debt.

**Deliberate and reckless:** You have the skills, so you know you're good for the work and are an expert at it, but you assume no consequence (think of this as being too cocky) and rush a speedy delivery that impacts overall quality.

> Deliberate and reckless technical debt happens when the team knows that a particular decision will result in tech debt but still moves forward because it prioritizes speed over quality. However, the team might not understand the repercussions of that decision.

You don't have all the skills (maybe because you're entering a new field or leveling up), but you're fully accountable for the outcome. Meaning you make a decision with the limited knowledge you had at the time, but you realize in hindsight you could have done something differently.

>This type of technical debt is related to learning and innovation. For example, when a developer is coding, they are learning. After some time of finishing a piece of software, a developer can understand how to implement a better solution. The developer can then take action and improve the code.

You're jumping from biz model to biz model. Squirrel brain. Shiny-object syndrome. This is where you have no skills and no accountability. Purely reckless and unaware of the mistakes you're making.

It happens when the team doesnâ€™t have enough experience and blindly implements a solution without realizing theyâ€™re getting into debt. A common situation is when an organization lacks human resources and needs to ask for inexperienced or non-professional developers to implement the software. As a result, the team will write low-quality code and generate technical debt. Recklessness or lack of knowledge can lead to unwanted issues which more experienced developers could easily avoid.
