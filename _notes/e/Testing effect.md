When you try to recall some detail from memory, that act strengthens your memory of that detail. When exploited as a learning activity, this is called “retrieval practice.”

Experiment has demonstrated this effect even when the correct answer is not provided (though [Retrieval practice may be less effective without feedback](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zyvKN4BdHujBNpez2uZjYx)), and even when the test-taker is given “open-book” access to find a correct answer. The effect has been demonstrated in many fields and at many age levels.

This suggests a significantly different role for tests. In typical classrooms, teachers and students imagine that learning happens during lectures, or while reading the material. The tests are there to assess that learning. But in fact, the tests themselves are an important part of the learning process.

## Versus other study activities

Retrieval practice leads to more durable long-term memory than simply studying material by e.g. re-reading, despite the fact that students will be less successful during practice itself (Roediger, 2006). Related: [Desirable difficulties, after Bjork](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zYB7kwEFRu8QALcbzbcoy9T).

It also seems to lead to more durable memory (Karpicke and Smith, 2012) and improved learning performance in general (Karpicke and Blunt, 2011) relative to [Elaborative encoding](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z9Uq4yzBT1QaBU8twwyvm7P)-based practice alone.

[The testing effect may be diminished or inverted for immediate tests](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zWoEKdbmtbSgAp1tZjU4usY)

## Format

The testing effect is generally measured to be more pronounced for production tests (short answer, essay) than for discrimination (multiple choice / true-false) (e.g. Kang et al, 2007). This may be due to the [Generation effect](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z26C6ing3sqiZMHRVFuT6xn).

    - A spaced-repetition memory system combines the [Testing effect](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zTpJdbe6ub7uhBFLuHkFsrT) and the [Spacing effect](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4KScVkQCD2XmVwvSDUbZtn) to enable efficient memorization of many thousands of facts ([Spaced repetition memory systems are extremely efficient](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z64yjxVfMvJTSAjWFpyEtnA)). Some people also use them for a broader set of tasks (see below). [Spaced repetition memory systems make memory a choice](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zSTqsQ4ATXB61k3Z43TforN), but they’re not just for rote facts: [Spaced repetition memory systems can be used to develop conceptual understanding](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z9Vi7YVx7NzxU2wawNgsJbk).

    - The simplest instantiation of the [Testing effect](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zTpJdbe6ub7uhBFLuHkFsrT) is elicited when students test themselves on a prompt which they’ll later be tested on (i.e. identically). So: say you memorize a thousand prompts about a topic. What we really care about is not just your ability to answer those specific questions, but how that practice affects your utilizable understanding of the topic. What can you actually do with it? If I ask you an open-ended question involving the knowledge you practiced, can you marshall that knowledge—i.e. [Transfer learning](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z7ffiDfqTR9pPcEEUUbCL7C).

Like Karpicke and Smith (2012), this paper is also interested in whether the effects of retrieval practice seem to be _due to_ elaborative encoding, or whether there’s some other process going on.
- [Karpicke, J. D., & Smith, M. A. (2012). Separate mnemonic effects of retrieval practice and elaborative encoding. Journal of Memory and Language, 67(1), 17–29](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z799fHyRM3qXFTLeEXUZQV7)

When you review prompts in a [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z2D1qPwddPktBjpNuwYFVva), you give yourself an opportunity to form new connections based on your current context and the different thoughts you have during the review session.
- [Generation effect](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z26C6ing3sqiZMHRVFuT6xn)
    - This effect is sometimes equated with the [Testing effect](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zTpJdbe6ub7uhBFLuHkFsrT): when students are asked to produce answers from memory (as in free recall tests), some part of the impact on recall may be due to the processing involved in generating the answers. But experiments by Karpicke and Zaromb (2010) suggest that the two effects are distinct and can be to some extent isolated. People who studied by trying to generating targets ended up with poorer recall than people who study by attempting to recall.

    - Of particular interest, he’s suggested that the [Testing effect](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zTpJdbe6ub7uhBFLuHkFsrT) has limitations for complex material: [van Gog, T., & Sweller, J.

- [Worked example effect](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zD8D8PPRBDEFk3JeM2vaWrn)
    - While the term “worked example effect” usually refers to comparisons of studying related worked examples to solving related problems, it’s sometimes discussed in comparison to the [Testing effect](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zTpJdbe6ub7uhBFLuHkFsrT)—i.e. is it better to study related worked examples, or to engage in [Retrieval practice](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zXA8c6XtMLgRCGwJFGnZUvw) by re-solving related problems? See e.g. Yeo and Fazio, 2019. [Jeffrey Karpicke](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z6d4D1bSzhdaGpnAKGBX3FT) argues (see commentary on [van Gog, T., & Sweller, J. (2015). Not New, but Nearly Forgotten: The Testing Effect Decreases or even Disappears as the Complexity of Learning Materials Increases. Educational Psychology Review, 27(2), 247–264](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zMjGz9ddgwjxadBRxQCnnWY)) that “the worked-example experiments all failed to show retrieval practice effects because of the way retrieval practice was implemented” (i.e. immediate, massed, “requiring no episodic context reinstatement”).
- [Spaced repetition memory systems can be used to develop conceptual understanding](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z9Vi7YVx7NzxU2wawNgsJbk)
    - It’s worth noting, too, that the cogpsy basis of spaced repetition (the [Testing effect](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zTpJdbe6ub7uhBFLuHkFsrT)) has been demonstrated for conceptual knowledge as well as for declarative knowledge (see Karpicke and Blunt, 2011). But should you practice integrative tasks for conceptual learning instead of atomic tasks (per [Spaced repetition memory prompts should usually focus on one atomic unit](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zFgK9ArxAXq57iMukRsVVE9))?

    - Questions inserted into a reading experience. These may be presented either before or after the content being tested. When placed after, these produce the [Testing effect](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zTpJdbe6ub7uhBFLuHkFsrT) on the specific information being tested, as one would expect. But they also produce a more general effect: [Adjunct questions improve comprehension of related but untested content](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4m9Gat7zi9YUmZzQRR7pwt). And there appear to be a [Pre-testing effect](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zCaVdAEo3YDwAbuxLeW9JZ7).

    - For related-but-untested material, the effect appears to apply both backwards (e.g. inducing additional processing of related-but-untested material you just read)—a somewhat generalized [Testing effect](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zTpJdbe6ub7uhBFLuHkFsrT)—and forwards (e.g. by priming relevant prior knowledge)—a [Pre-testing effect](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zCaVdAEo3YDwAbuxLeW9JZ7).
- [Evergreen note maintenance approximates spaced repetition](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zWbMsEFW9LD4vsoVhaDcF4u)
    - This isn’t an efficient spaced repetition, memory-wise: you’re not really taking advantage of the [Testing effect](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zTpJdbe6ub7uhBFLuHkFsrT). But it does take advantage of something like the [Generation effect](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z26C6ing3sqiZMHRVFuT6xn), and it may be a useful lens to think about managing your attention across the corpus of ideas you accumulate over time. Specifically, this practice will encourage you to repeatedly give attention to past ideas which seem relevant to your present work. And because you may find yourself revising your notes on those past ideas, the attention may be quite effortful.

    - In a [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z2D1qPwddPktBjpNuwYFVva), the central noun is the prompt—a task constructed to promote [Retrieval practice](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zXA8c6XtMLgRCGwJFGnZUvw) or to produce the [Testing effect](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zTpJdbe6ub7uhBFLuHkFsrT). But I’m interested in exploring an alternative formulation in which _ideas_ are the core noun, or at least exist alongside prompts. To put this another way: to put something into a memory system right now, you encode it into prompts and tasks. What if, instead, you could put _the thing itself_ into the memory system? And then, when you show up for your daily review sessions, you’d be presented with activities which reinforce and deepen those things?
    - It seems pretty obvious to me that this is the conceptual model we’d have used from the start if it were possible… the trouble is that _it doesn’t work!_ [Readwise](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zAt1K9ARQYguinoHH8cfaqQ)-like systems which just resurface the idea itself as the practice session don’t produce a [Testing effect](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zTpJdbe6ub7uhBFLuHkFsrT), and few people seem to stick with it. I haven’t used [Kawara](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zMbLoCcRACLn2Enfuo5KjyK) much, or interviewed its users, but I suspect it would have the same problem.

    - Critically, it may not have even really worked; see Pressey (1962), p.32’s litany of studies with null experimental results (i.e. in comparison to simply reading the questions and answers transformed into declarative sentences). This would be surprising, given [Testing effect](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zTpJdbe6ub7uhBFLuHkFsrT), but it may be a representation of just how damaging the format was to the reading process.

    - The authors point out in this paper that the literature on [Spaced repetition memory system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z2D1qPwddPktBjpNuwYFVva) has mostly focused on finding the schedule regime which produces the highest recall rates, irrespective of time costs. The [Testing effect](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zTpJdbe6ub7uhBFLuHkFsrT) is powerful; more practice will produce more stability. So how should one think about these trade-offs?

    - The authors demonstrate that making [Adjunct questions](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zSoTbuyrXFnDHibaSeEzPRx) function as [Retrieval practice](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zXA8c6XtMLgRCGwJFGnZUvw) (i.e. via closed-book testing) is a double-edged strategy: closed-book practice improves recall, but it also lowers immediate performance. When adjunct questions are complex, the impact on immediate performance is enough to produce an **inverted** [Testing effect](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zTpJdbe6ub7uhBFLuHkFsrT). i.e: “a closed-book implementation style can substantially moderate the superiority of high complexity adjunct questions.” This is an interesting answer to [How complex should tasks be for test-enhanced learning?](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4jkVxd8nCgsfsz5mYGPU4z).

    - **Testing effect vs. facilitation effects:** Critically, he also distinguishes between the effects of these questions on subsequent performance on those questions, and on other questions about different details in the passage. Here he’s trying to distinguish between the direct instructional effects of practice (i.e. [Testing effect](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zTpJdbe6ub7uhBFLuHkFsrT)) and the more general facilitative effects of being asked questions while one reads. He verifies that there’s no transfer between these two sets of questions by letting a separate group of students practice the adjunct questions and then testing them on the “unrelated” questions (both pre- and post-practice). He finds that mere practice on the adjunct questions does not improve performance on the “unrelated” questions. He concludes that any performance improvement in the reading experiment must come from “general facilitation effects”, rather than direct testing effects of the adjunct questions. (This is a really nice approach!)

    - The authors point out that almost all the literature about the [Testing effect](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zTpJdbe6ub7uhBFLuHkFsrT) has worked with quite low complexity material, even when testing with students in classrooms. But there are studies dating back to 1914 (Kühn) and 1917 (Gates) which show diminished or absent testing effects for material with higher [Element interactivity](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zBk3AaWYp4spoTbc1f5aYvC).
    - Roelle and Berthed mention van Gog and Sweller’s concerns here. They explain the lack of testing effect in the cited experiments by pointing out that the conditions didn’t have the same kind of knowledge construction. The re-study “might have had an advantage because their task (rereading) made it possible for them to make connections between the target content items, whereas the learners in the retrieval groups, who were instructed to retrieve keywords missing from the content, probably did not engage in this relational processing.” In R+B’s experiments, the tasks are the same, and retrieval is controlled by making study open vs closed book. And they do indeed find a [Testing effect](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zTpJdbe6ub7uhBFLuHkFsrT).
