Naive practice methods are limited in scope: [[Naive approaches to practice rapidly plateau]]. But it’s not as simple as replacing naive methods with better methods because [[Performance plateaus often require a change in approach to surmount]]. One’s practice methods must evolve with one’s performance because [[Skill development requires challenging homeostasis]].

This often means that practice methods must be designed and maintained by an expert: [[Expert coaches facilitate effective deliberate practice]].
