**What is a cult?**

A hierarchical organisation created by a charismatic narcissist leader, which uses mind control techniques to amass money, power and sex.

**Key words:** 

> Mind viruses; grifter;



**Why does it happen?**

Started by a [[zen devil]].

A scam has to be: 
1. charismatic enough, that it attracts prey. 
2. It has to be convincing enough that the prey attempts it. 
3. It has to have the perpetual hanging carrot on the stick, so that the prey is under illusion of that dream that is "by inches unachievable goal".

**Concepts that are manifested:**

- [[Ponzi scheme]]
- [[Ponzinomics, the Untold Story of Multi-Level Marketing - Rob Fitzpatrick]]

It's not that the groups themselves are inherently bad, it's how they create mind-viruses.

What underpins all the self-help groups?

**Main techniques**

- [[Gaslighting]]
- [[Trance and Hypnosis in cults]]
- [[Peer pressure and modeling]]
- [[Emotional manipulation]]

**Damage control and recovery**


**Why am I so passionate about researching this?**

Young men want to provide, earn respect, wield power, climb the social ladder, and enjoy a fulfilling sex life. Nothing wrong with that; it's about becoming the best version of yourself. The issue? When these ambitions get co-opted by charlatans who claim they can hand you all of this on a platter. That's nonsense. Authentic transformation comes from within, not from some external guru.

Why do we buy into these snake oil salesmen? Well, the world's a mess, leaving many young men disillusioned and questioning their identity and principles. It's all too easy to fall into a state of nihilism or adopt a defeatist mindset. Add to that a lack of genuine masculine role models, and you've got fertile ground for guru worship. That's when the real problems kick in: you become susceptible to manipulation and halt your own personal development.

I'm committed to steering peopleâ€”especially those who resemble my own experiences and challengesâ€”away from this perilous path of falsehood. While I harbor a sense of indignation towards the charlatans who orchestrate these scams, I also recognize they are driven by their own ego and immaturity. The key then is to deconstruct immaturity to help others cultivate maturityâ€”for others to be the change they are so ardently seeking.
