### Introduction

Before diving into this exploration of the intricate relationship between politics, government, and spirituality, there are some prerequisite concepts you'll need to grasp. These include:

- **Non-duality:** The philosophical, spiritual, and scientific understanding of non-separation and fundamental intrinsic oneness.
- [[Spiral Dynamics]]: A psychological approach to understanding the evolution of human consciousness.
- [[Self-deception]]: The mechanisms by which individuals lie to themselves to evade moral responsibility.
- **Survival:** The basic drive behind all human actions and systems.
- **Collective Ego:** The shared illusions and beliefs that hold together any social construct, be it a tribe, nation, or ideology.
- **Devilry:** A comprehensive understanding of what constitutes "evil," its origins, and its mechanisms.
- **Ideology:** The understanding of how belief systems shape our actions and justifications.
- **Relativity & Relativism:** The understanding that points of view have no absolute truth or validity but only relative, subjective value according to differences in perception.
- [[atlas/maps/The Cynefin framework]]: A holistic approach to understanding how individual actions contribute to collective outcomes.
- **Love:** The ultimate antidote to ego and the key to transcending self-interest.

### The Self-Deception of Politics and Government

Politics and government operate in a domain rife with self-deception. Both politicians and voters participate in a charade, often unknowingly, that perpetuates systems counterintuitive to the well-being of the collective.

### The Global Relevance of Conservatism vs. Liberalism

While the discourse will often reference Republicans and Democrats, it's crucial to understand that the tension between conservatism and liberalism isn't confined to American politics. These are global archetypes reflecting fundamental human orientations toward change, authority, and collective well-being.

Now that the stage is set, let's delve deeper into the labyrinthine world where spirituality and politics intersect, challenge, and inform each other.
