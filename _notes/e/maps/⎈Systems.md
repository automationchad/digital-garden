What is a system?

> “…dividing the cow in half does not give you two smaller cows. You may end up with a lot of hamburger, but the essential nature of “cow” — a living system capable, among other things, of turning grass into milk — then would be lost. This is what we mean when we say a system functions as a “whole”. Its behavior depends on its entire structure and not just on adding up the behavior of its different pieces.” — ==[Kauffman, 1980, p2](https://www.academia.edu/3317732/Systems_one_An_introduction_to_systems_thinking)==

`Def:`A system must be both dynamic (constantly changing) and evolving (having emergent properties). It must be connected to elements, actors, agencies, nodes, stocks or ‘parts,’ and have a boundary. The edge of the universe is perhaps one exception to this, but we can still define a solar system by the boundaries of a constellation.
