Hidden doors are like the Easter Eggs of the metaphorical building: they're concealed within the architecture, revealing themselves only to those who know where to look or those willing to explore beyond the obvious. Much like Easter Eggs in video games, which are hidden features or tricks that developers include as bonuses for the particularly curious or diligent player, hidden doors offer unique rewards or experiences that aren't part of the main storyline or conventional path.

In systems, organizations, or even life itself, hidden doors represent opportunities that are not apparent unless one is willing to dig deeper or think outside the box. These could range from lesser-known scholarships and grants to funding a startup, to unique skill sets that make you valuable in ways that are not immediately obvious.

The allure of hidden doors or Easter Eggs lies in their exclusivity and the satisfaction of having discovered something unique. They reward curiosity, initiative, and attention to detail. However, it's worth noting that what lies behind a hidden door is not always beneficial or pleasant; the term doesn't inherently imply value or safety, just concealment. Therefore, as with all other doors, due diligence and preparation are key.

Personal mantra update: Make room for curiosity and exploration to find those hidden doors. The path less traveled can sometimes lead to the most rewarding experiences, but always go prepared. Finding a hidden door is like unlocking a secret level in a game; it's a unique reward for those who go beyond the surface. However, be prepared for anything, as not all Easter Eggs or hidden doors lead to favorable outcomes.
