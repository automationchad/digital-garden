> â€œMoney, being naturally barren, to make it breed money is preposterous and a perversion from the end of its institution, which was only to serve the purpose of exchange and not of increase... Men called bankers we shall hate, for they enrich themselves while doing nothing."" â€“ Aristotle, Politics

Commerce, as it's often seen, is a mirage. We trade paper for paper, believing we're rich. [[If you win the rat race, you're still a rat]].

Real satisfaction doesn't come from hollow transactions. 

The mindset that encourages becoming a [[landlord]] and *accumulating* vast amounts of wealth often stems from a distorted understanding of money's original purpose. 

Initially, money was designed to ease the process of exchange and to serve as a vehicle for community investment, rather than as a resource to be stockpiled.

Once money becomes a commodity, it's subjected to market forces of supply and demand, speculative trading, and hoarding. This gives rise to financialisation: the financial industry ruling over the real economy. 

This can be seen clearly in the rise of asset classes like [[cryptocurrency]], which often serve more as speculative investments than as mediums of exchange AND the perversion of real assets (like land) becoming instruments for speculative gains rather than real productivity.

Through the issuance of loansâ€”a practice which could be likened to [[usury]]â€”banks generate money that often recirculates within asset markets rather than contributing to societal well-being.

This dynamic essentially creates a zero-sum situation: gains for the private banker or landlord are offset by losses for laborers and entrepreneurs, without the creation of any meaningful, tangible value.

So if the medium of exchange is sort of fucked, where do we go from here?

Answer: [[There are only varying levels of active income]]
