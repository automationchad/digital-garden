> Trapdoors are for the audacious who are willing to gamble big for potentially monumental gains, fully aware of the irreversible nature of their actions.

Trapdoors add yet another layer of complexity to this metaphorical landscape of doors and access points. Unlike backdoors and sidedoors, which are essentially alternative entry points, trapdoors are designed to be one-way mechanisms. Once you go through a trapdoor, it's difficult, if not impossible, to return the way you came. They are irreversible actions or decisions that propel you into a new space, often with far-reaching consequences.

Marriage, having children, or perhaps even something like emigrating to a far-off country could be considered "trapdoors."

In the world of cryptography, a trapdoor function is easy to perform in one direction but extremely difficult to reverse unless you possess specific knowledge (the 'trapdoor' key). In life and systems, think of trapdoors as decisions or moves that radically change the landscape. These could range from whistleblowing on an illicit organizational practice to making a groundbreaking innovation that disrupts an industry.

When utilizing a trapdoor, the stakes are inherently higher. The level of commitment is absolute, and you need to be prepared for whatever awaits on the other side. Confidence, in this context, won't just suffice—you also need thorough preparation and a full understanding of the ramifications. The risk of expulsion is not just a temporary inconvenience; it can be a game-changing event that could either catapult you to unprecedented heights or lead to an irreversible downfall.

Personal mantra update: Consider trapdoors as the high-risk, high-reward options. They're not for the faint of heart or for those unwilling to accept a point of no return. If you're going to pull the lever, be damn sure you're ready for whatever comes next—whether that's uncharted territories or unforeseen challenges.
