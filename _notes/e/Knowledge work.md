After “knowledge industries” were introduced as a key U.S. economic concern by Fritz Machlup in 1962, Peter Drucker described those activities as “knowledge work” in 1969. ==Or perhaps in 1966 in _The Effective Executive_—will need to check==

Machlup points out in 1962 that 29% of US GDP is attributable to the “knowledge industry.”
