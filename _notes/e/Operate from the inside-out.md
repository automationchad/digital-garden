Most of us seek answers in the external world ([[External movement does not detach us from ourselves]]), but the right answers for you are already within, hiding in plain sight. 

Creating an amazing life must happen from the inside-out. Most of us are too caught up in external circumstances to create the kind of life we want. Realize that the outer world is changed by changing your inner world.

Lean into the deep work required to understand your inner world. Introspect to find your desires, your values, your gifts. Untangle the emotional threads running through your life. This is how you find the raw material for creative work no one else but you could do.

It’s not you *and* the world, or you ‘versus’ the world. You are a part of the world, you ARE the world. This is the difference between seeing life as forces acting on you, and you BEING the force that acts upon the world. Former is limited, latter is unlimited. You are elemental.

We live simultaneously in two worlds: outer world and inner world. Big mistake to think of it as one world. Simply NOT true. There are two worlds.

The quality and degree of concentration of the thoughts you think shapes your whole life.

- Ask yourself, Are my thoughts productive or petty?

We live in the inner world in a state of constant reaction to the outer world. So we have no personal power. [[Pitching out corrupts within]]

It's important to recognize the difference between the two worlds:

- Different laws
- Different possibilities

Confidence, worry, fear, happiness, and meaning does NOT exist in the outer world.

Most people live life in reaction. Their inner world merely reflects their outer world. Mesmerized by the outer world.

Most people focus on the outer world far too much. No! You should be entirely focused on your inner world.

Your mind is in constant motion. It is always thinking thoughts.

There is a lot of useless thought going on inside you: worry, anxiety, negatives, fears.

Recognize that you've lost control of the mechanism.

You are not your thoughts.

Thoughts are powerful when focused. Unfocused thoughts are weak, just like sunlight and a magnifying glass.

Train your mind to generate thoughts independently of what present reality would suggest.

Thoughts are real forces:

- Only two things shape your life: your thoughts and your actions.
- No action can happen without you thinking about it.
- Thoughts are creative substances and each has an affect on your life.

You have the power to insert any thought into your mind.

- You must think positive, constructive thoughts especially when you're doing badly.

The inner and outer worlds are connected.

- 4 stages of creation with mind powers:

- Stage 1: x = x
- Stage 2: x + y = x (reality is a delayed response to your consciousness)
- Stage 3: x + y = x + y (start to see intermittent results)
- Stage 4: x + y = y

- Must pass through all 4 stages. Be especially aware of stage 2 and 3, which can be discouraging.

Inner Game vs Outer Game — understand the deep importance of inner game in your pursuit of success. A level 2 person will crumble under the weight of a level 5 problem. The solution is to raise your level.
