When building an interconnected personal knowledge base (e.g. [[Evergreen notes should be densely linked]]), is it critical to build all the associations by hand? Tools like DEVONthink use machine learning to suggest “related” notes. And on the web, one’s history (perhaps even contextualized within a single tab’s timeline) can suggest some relationships between content. Or: can we just use search functionality when we want to navigate around a set of ideas?

Tools like these can be helpful for scaffolding the associative process, and they can serve as a second place to look for linkages, but we shouldn’t rely on them to do all the work.

First: the process of thinking about the relationships between items is part of how you can [[Do your own thinking]]. It forces you to engage with new material more deeply.

Second: you want your associations to be high-signal so that you don’t have to try to evaluate some unordered list of links. Being able to quickly evaluate such a list without navigating among the items requires that you remember what all those items contain. Tightly-curated associations will be higher-signal.

Third: your terminology will evolve over time, so text-based linkages aren’t going to help long-term.
