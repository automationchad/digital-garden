In ancient Athens, citizenship wasn't an isolated function but interwoven with philosophy, psychology, ethics, and politics. Theories informed practices, and from this integrated approach, true political advances emerged. Today, our theories are woefully inadequate, leading to misguided practices.

### The Corrupting Forces: Selfishness, Bias, and Ideology

The first issue is that discussions around politics are immediately tainted by selfishness, bias, and entrenched ideologies. These factors ignite culture wars, distracting us from the real issues at hand. What's needed is a perspective that rises above these divisive forces, transcending the limitations of both left and right. Unfortunately, because the sides are not equally evolved—with the right often lagging in consciousness—a higher perspective is often mistaken for leftism. But make no mistake, politics and governance are matters of life and death, a fertile ground for devilry.

### The Invisible Hand: Government Taken for Granted

The second problem is the complacency with which we treat government. People fail to recognize how far society has come, largely due to effective governance. You can go about your day, utilize public services, and consume resources without once thinking about the governmental systems that make it all possible. This is a glaring oversight. Government is not just a necessary evil; it's a form of social technology. Ideas like democracy, free speech, judicial fairness, separation of church and state, minority rights, and environmental protection were once radical notions. They're now part of the societal fabric because someone had the audacity to conceive and fight for them.

### The Complexity of Scale

Moreover, the government operates on a scale that dwarfs any corporation. It has to manage the lives, freedoms, and resources of hundreds of millions of people. The fact that life in the 21st century is considerably better than in previous eras is a testament to the effectiveness of this "technology."

> TL;DR - If we're to address the problems with today's politics, we need to go back to a more integrated way of thinking—one that acknowledges the intricate dance between theory and practice, and respects the monumental achievements of governance while striving for higher consciousness and unity.
