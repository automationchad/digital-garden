Write a manifesto for any long-term project or endeavor where you might start to doubt yourself when the going gets tough. A manifesto is a written document — like a business plan — that outlines the core principles behind your decision to start the project. A manifesto addresses the following points:

- List of principles by which you will develop the project
- List of the reasons why you're doing it
- List of the things you do not want
- List of specific things you want to accomplish in this
- Backup — Easy to backup your most important work.
- Points of consolation — what do you want to tell yourself when you're struggling and about to give up?
- List of the biggest challenges — what is most likely to derail the project?

Examples of endeavors that you'd want to write a manifesto for:

- Moving to another city
- Getting a new job
- Starting a business
- Getting married
- Starting a diet
- Quitting alcohol or drugs
- Starting a new hobby like piano
- Writing a book
