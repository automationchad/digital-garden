*It's an interconnected set of solutions to common problems*.

An organized and coherent set of _patterns_, each of which describes a problem and the core of a solution that can be used in many ways within a specific field of expertise.

Coined by architect Christopher Alexander in [Pattern Language - Christopher Alexander]

## What is a pattern?

When a designer designs something – whether a house, computer program, or lamp – they must make many decisions about how to solve problems. A single problem is documented with its typical place (the [syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax "Syntax")), and use (the [grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammar "Grammar")) with the most common and recognized good solution seen in the wild, like the examples seen in [dictionaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary "Dictionary"). Each such entry is a single [[Design pattern]]. Each pattern has a name, a descriptive entry, and some cross-references, much like a dictionary entry. A documented pattern should explain why that solution is good in the pattern's contexts.

- The language description – the _vocabulary_ – is a collection of named, described solutions to problems in a field of interest. These are called _design patterns_. So, for example, the language for architecture describes items like: settlements, buildings, rooms, windows, latches, etc.
- Each solution includes _syntax_, a description that shows where the solution fits in a larger, more comprehensive or more abstract design. This automatically links the solution into a web of other needed solutions. For example, rooms have ways to get light, and ways to get people in and out.
- The solution includes _grammar_ that describes how the solution solves a problem or produces a benefit. So, if the benefit is unneeded, the solution is not used. Perhaps that part of the design can be left empty to save money or other resources; if people do not need to wait to enter a room, a simple doorway can replace a waiting room.
- In the language description, grammar and syntax cross index (often with a literal alphabetic index of pattern names) to other named solutions, so the designer can quickly think from one solution to related, needed solutions, and document them in a logical way. In Christopher Alexander's book _A Pattern Language_, the patterns are in decreasing order by size, with a separate alphabetic index.
- The web of relationships in the index of the language provides many paths through the design process.

> A pattern is a named description of a recurring solution to a problem in a given context. The description should give readers a deep enough understanding or the problem to either apply the stated solution to their own context or decide that a particular pattern is not appropriate to their situation.
