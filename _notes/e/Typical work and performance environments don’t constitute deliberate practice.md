Effective [[Deliberate practice, after Ericsson]] offers students opportunities for focused repetitions. During a baseball game, a batter may only swing a dozen times, but a batter working with an expert coach may attempt hundreds of pitches a day. Even better: those pitches may all be designed to exploit a specific weakness (Ericsson et al, 1993, p. 368).

Because [[Skill development requires challenging homeostasis]], failure must be common during deliberate practice. But typical work and performance environments rarely tolerate high rates of failure. A pianist can’t practice his fingerings by scheduling more recitals: he’ll quickly be kicked off the touring circuit.
