Conscious politics is an antidote to the pervasive corruption, inequality, and inefficiencies that plague our current systems. Here's how to revamp the status quo:

#### Remove Money from Politics

Publicly finance all elections and criminalize lobbying. Money has no place in a system that should prioritize the public good.

#### Redistrict Without Bias

End gerrymandering. The drawing of district lines should be automated or managed by an impartial council to preserve the essence of one person, one vote.

#### Democratize the Electoral Process

Eliminate the Electoral College. Make Election Day a federal holiday. Introduce ranked-choice voting and encourage a multi-party system.

#### Stop the Revolving Door

Ban lobbyists from holding public offices. Impose a 10-year gap between leaving a lobbying role and entering public office, and vice versa.

#### Tax the Ultra-Wealthy

Impose significant taxation on extreme wealth and high corporate incomes. Close tax loopholes and tax havens. Money should serve the public, not just sit in offshore accounts.

#### Regulate Predatory Industries

Stringent oversight for industries known for exploitation—like banking, pharmaceuticals, and big tech—is non-negotiable.

#### Empower the Workforce

Encourage unionization. Require corporations to have workers on their boards. Transform the minimum wage into a living wage.

#### Prioritize Environmental Sustainability

Shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy. Tax polluters. Fund extensive research into sustainable technologies.

#### Reform the Criminal Justice System

End for-profit prisons. Focus on rehabilitation over punishment. Decriminalize minor drug offenses and offer addiction treatment.

#### Invest in Public Services

Fund education, healthcare, and infrastructure. Offer free or subsidized services to elevate the quality of life for everyone.

#### Promote Transparency and Accountability

Make government contract awards transparent. Strongly penalize white-collar crimes. Protect whistleblowers.

#### Address Cultural and Psychological Elements

Fund mental health services. Encourage arts and sciences. Foster a culture where success is measured by well-being and consciousness, not GDP.

#### Additional Measures

- Implement empirical testing for public policy effectiveness.
- Consider Universal Basic Income (UBI) as a means to free people from survival anxiety, encouraging creativity and entrepreneurship.

### The Ultimate Vision

The government's role is strategic, not invasive. It's about creating a system so fair and equitable that it elevates the collective consciousness. This involves cultural shifts and individual transformations.

**Objection: what will people do once government provides all their survival needs?**

These people will self-actualize.  You can’t truly do that until your survival needs are met.  Life then becomes about a sense of life purpose, helping your community.  Then ultimately it becomes about self-transcendence, spirituality, enlightenment and radiating pure love. Living out of fear and scarcity could motivate you, but that's a very crude barbaric animal form of motivation.

**Objection: if government is corrupt doesn't that mean we need less of it?**

This is a misunderstanding of the problem.  If you eliminate government corruption is not going away.  You're just removing that balance of power such that all the corruption will now be unchecked in the corporate sector.

The corporate sector is totally corrupt.  Government is a check on that, even if the government is corrupt it's still a check on the much larger corruption within the corporate environment.

**Government needs to be as big as it needs to be to manage the complexity of the society.**  Be careful not to conflate corruption with government.  These are two different things.

**Objection: isn’t taxation theft?**

Taxation is not theft because the notion of theft and property rights does not exist without a government.  What libertarians don't understand is that there's no such thing as property rights in the natural world, in the animal kingdom.

In the animal kingdom might is right.  Anyone can overpower and enslave you.  The whole point of government is to mollify that and make it more manageable.  If you’re living by yourself in the jungle, I can point a gun at your head and say, “I now own your shelter.  I drink your milkshake.”  That's how total freedom really works.

Property rights are enforced because of government.  Taxation is the cost you pay for property rights that the government secures for you.  It’s a tradeoff between a bit of taxation for the safety and security that government provides.

You're completely ignoring all the benefits that government provides to you such as roads, bridges, military protections, postal services, natural disaster relief, and so forth.

**Objection: With high taxation what will motivate the millionaires and the billionaires to work?**  They’ll stop creating jobs!

These millionaires and billionaires already have enough money that they're not doing it for the money.  These people were driven by a desire for power, maybe a desire for fame, for success, for creativity, for artistry, for entrepreneurship, for the challenge of it, for a sense of life purpose.  If it was just money they would have quit their jobs decades ago.

The payoff for a human is the psychic payoff that you get from the work.  There's only so much food you can eat at an all-you-can-eat buffet.  At some point it becomes sickening and you wonder what's next.  Then you discover creativity, art, beauty, philosophy, science, life purpose, love, consciousness, spirituality, God and that's when your life really becomes amazing.

**Objection: This sounds so utopian.**

This is a long term, big picture vision, with a 100 to 500 year time frame.  So, if your time frame is 10 years then it sounds utopian.  Also, many of these things are achievable even in the short term.

Evolution cannot be stopped.  It's moving towards higher love and consciousness.  It's just a question of time

**Objection: Communism failed in North Korea, the Soviet Union, Venezuela, etc.**

Those countries were grossly underdeveloped, extremely corrupt, at stage red of [[Spiral Dynamics]].  These policies can only be implemented in a post-orange society.  That doesn't mean we completely eradicate capitalism, but we exhaust capitalism to its limits.  Become conscious of the limits of capitalism.

Many of these ideas will work, especially in Northern Europe and America because we are already at orange.

It’s been tried, and has worked, in Scandinavian countries, Canada, and certain progressive cities and states in America (California, Washington, New York).  _It’s not an accident that Washington state, NY state, and California state are some of the wealthiest states in the in the country._

**Objection: Are You Advocating for Equality of Outcome or Equality of Opportunity?**

This is a silly Jordan Peterson talking point, as if any reasonable person would argue for total equality of outcome.  That’s a [[strawman]].  We're talking about equality of opportunity.

Looking at the outcomes shows you where the system is rigged, so that you can change the system to then produce more equal opportunity.  How are African-Americans doing relative to white people?  Rich relative to the poor?  Inner city relative to private school kids?

There's a fantasy amongst libertarians and conservatives that we've already solved equality of opportunity and now all these SJWs want equality of outcome.  What a social justice warrior wants is a more fair, equal society, that's less rigged towards the wealthiest at the top and towards those who have traditionally had a lot of power which was white men.  Social justice warriors fighting for social justice has been the cause of basically all political movements since the dawn of time.

eg: Jews rebelling against the Egyptian pharaoh in the bible.  Spartacus’ gladiator revolt against the Roman Empire.  Jesus standing up to the Roman Empire.  Martin Luther King, Gandhi, the Protestant Reformation, etc.

**What is political history, human history, but standing up against gross injustices?**  Standing up against slavery, against various kinds of apartheid, segregation, Jim Crow, oppression of women, Nazi’s, the Holocaust, and so forth.

**Objection: Aren't some people just doomed to be failures and screwups?**

I'm not saying that we can fix everybody, that everyone's going to be enlightened and loving.  The point is not to fix everybody, but to create a system of regulations, rules and infrastructure to _make it easy for the majority of people to evolve._

Lifting oneself up by one's bootstraps doesn't solve all collective problems.  The government is going to provide you the boots and the knowledge you need to pull yourself up.

**Objection: Won't all this be resisted by the status quo and impossible to implement?**

There's always resistance to change, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't try to change.  It's a fight.  Some lose, some win, but in overall scheme things are improving, getting more complex and becoming more whole and more unified at higher levels.

**Objection: This is more radical than the SJWs and typical leftists.**

The issue isn’t whether it's radical or not.  The issue is what's right.  What's going to lead to higher consciousness and more love?  When you're stuck in a shithole greatness seems radical.  When you're barely able to make ends meet some vision of being a millionaire seems radical, seems impossible.
