If you win the rat race, you're still a rat. It's about picking the right race to run. 

Focus on sectors that actually produce value—like real estate, mining, and engineering. Avoid ones that just play with numbers—like finance and stock trading.

Ultimately, you end up picking a race that you'll want to keep running even when it comes to a "finish". Work that you would do regardless of money. 

> Here's the irony: By working as if you don't need money, it finds it way to you.

That's how you escape the rat race.
