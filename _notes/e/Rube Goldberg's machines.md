A [chain reaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction "Chain reaction")–type machine or contraption intentionally designed to perform a simple task in an indirect and (impractically) overly complicated way. Usually, these machines consist of a series of simple unrelated devices; the action of each triggers the initiation of the next, eventually resulting in achieving a stated goal.
