> Winning three stars has got to be the most exciting journey of a chef’s life. Retaining them is the most boring job in the world.”

Once you've realized your dream: It's no longer personal it's mechanical. It's about being a well-oiled machine. It's boring.

Michelin told him: 

> "Never forget what made you great"  

What did they mean? It means stand behind your stove. Never let your ego or confidence detract you from the work that it took to get you there.

> “Winning three stars was just a stepping stone to where I wanted to be in life…..I was never ambitious. If I ever was ambitious then it was by default from just doing my job….. My entire motivation was to be accepted…..We have to question ourselves, especially if we want to turn our dreams into reality.

> In January 1998 we won three stars and five red knives and forks. The truth is, I never won 3 stars. I didn’t. I was the composer, the conductor. The chefs behind me, they were the ones who won the three stars. Not me.

Once [[Marco Pierre White]] realized his ambitions, he faced a trilemma:

1. Maintain his prestige at the cost of personal and familial well-being, working grueling 80-90 hour weeks and ending up drained by Sunday.
2. Compromise his integrity by falsely claiming active involvement in the kitchen while still charging premium prices.
3. Hang up the apron, relinquish his Michelin stars and downgrade his material status, opting for lifestyle over the Michelin treadmill.

He thought: 

> "You're being judged by people who have less knowledge than you"

If you've been given awards from people who don't have as much knowledge about your craft...what do the awards really mean?

And so he gave them up.

> “I had worked 22 years for something that I had never wanted.”

We work all our lives for these dreams to realize that we never wanted them in the first place. Why?

> "I needed the Michelin stars to take me to the next level to start to understand what I really want out of life."

> “By discovering yourself, then you have the opportunity to accept yourself. Through acceptance you do things for the right reason….you have the opportunity to realize your true potential. But you have to go deeper and really question everything.”

> “It’s about self belief, at whatever cost.”

Sometimes you need to touch the hot stove to understand things.

Pierre Koffmann inspired White the most. After achieving his three Michelin stars, Koffman gave them back to run a small restaurant.

> “Today he has a restaurant in London with no stars. But you know something? It’s my favourite restaurant in Britain. You know why? Because he cooks food you want to eat.”

Q: What's the best meal you've ever eaten?

A: It's not about the food. It's about the moment, food's secondary.

1. Great ambiance
2. Great company
3. Great service
4. Great food

Serve it hot, serve it quick and [[Keep it simple, stupid]].
