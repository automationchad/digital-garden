Everyone wants to find someone who's perfect, while ignoring the fact they they themselves aren't perfect and still evolving. It's not about who's perfect. It's who's perfect for you. And perfect for you is someone who also recognises that growth happens together and perpetually.

- Want the same thing from our futures.
- Nobody has to fundamental sacrifice themselves in order to remain in the partnership.
- You’re able to maintain a degree of separateness and polarity.
- You’re committed to growing together.
