Commerce, as it's often seen, is a mirage. We trade paper for paper, believing we're rich. [[If you win the rat race, you're still a rat]].

Real satisfaction doesn't come from hollow transactions. Itâ€™s a zero-sum game â€” one wins, another loses, with no tangible value created. Businesses and products, however, are real. They have form, substance, and purpose. When an entrepreneur crafts a business, they create tangible value. Whether it's automating processes or crafting unique travel experiences, the satisfaction from these creations dwarfs any financial gain.

Despite the buzz of stocks, bonds, or crypto, they're mere distractions from real value. They may be popular, but they're fleeting. It's tangible creations that last and truly matter.

Yet, society lures us with passive income, painting it as the ultimate dream. But let's be blunt: it's a myth. There's no 'passive fitness', is there? The universe's nature leans towards entropy, chaos. Left unchecked, things deteriorate. Countering entropy needs work, active effort. True income isn't passive; itâ€™s earned. If you think you can sit back and watch wealth grow, you're misled. It contradicts nature's law. [[There are only varying levels of active income]].

Real success is active effort countering entropy.

Take Mario, the Italian hotelier. Not a billionaire lounging on a yacht, but rich in real terms. Wealth for him isnâ€™t in currency, but in relationships and the joy of creation. Heâ€™s hands-on, creating active value. Thatâ€™s genuine wealth and a life truly lived.
