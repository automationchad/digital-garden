A journey through Carl Nygard's [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carl-nygard/details/experience/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carl-nygard/details/experience/) reveals a path not often highlighted in today's rapid-content culture...

Notice something?

Over eight years, he immersed himself deeply into his profession before transitioning to consulting. No YouTube channel. No courses. Just dedicated, hands-on experience. 

This brings to light a key understanding: [[Unstandardized outcomes cannot be standardized.]]

It's an important reminder that there's no template for unique achievements. 

Every individual journey is just that - individual. 

Yet, today's young generation, is often misled. Many believe they can become experts overnight, largely thanks to videos and online courses. 

But expertise can't be rushed or faked. And the marketplace reflects this. 

Yes, there are plenty of self-proclaimed 'gurus' eager to sell their knowledge....

But as Nicolas Taleb wisely points out:

> “Beware of the person who gives advice, telling you that a certain action on your part is “good for you” while it is also good for him, while the harm to you doesn’t directly affect him.” — Nicolas Taleb

While these gurus might find some success, they're mostly catering to those who're equally lost — dweebs and squids selling and buying from dweebs and squids (See: [[Ouroboros]], [[Pyramid scheme]])

Want to land the big clients? Prove yourself first. Earn your place. Dive deep into your field. Grind. Learn. [[Pathemata mathemata]]. Achieve. And when you've amassed enough genuine experience, then, and only then, consider selling your expertise.

Take my uncle, for example. Today, he's raking in $5M a year as a consultant. But he didn't start there. He dedicated 25 years, working tirelessly, before he ventured into consultancy. 

And why can he charge what he does now? Because he truly understands complex problems. He spent many years accruing a random selection of skills and experiences and deployed them against many different types of problems.

Don't rush to be the strategist. Without genuine experience, it's impossible to discern which strategies are effective. Instead, focus on the groundwork. Build your foundation. With time and perseverance, you can draw the insights backwards.
