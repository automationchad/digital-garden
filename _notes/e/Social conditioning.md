Social conditioning keeps you from following your heart. Right what you think are your values might not be your own but those of society, media, or other people. You cannot be happy living someone else's values. Social conditioning limits your options in career, business, and relationships.

Social conditioning is 3rd person knowledge that you've accepted as true based on hearsay. It's impossible to avoid 3rd hand knowledge â€” you can't test everything 1st hand â€” but you should try, as much as possible, to verify your knowledge and beliefs personally. It's very easy to absorb false or limiting information from the media, friends, and family.

It's incredible how much social conditioning is holding you back from living your dreams. We are like fish in water, not realizing the effect that social condition has. Every time you peal back a layer of social conditioning â€” you actually see it â€” you have an Ah-ha moment. The problem is, most people have too few of them.

High-achievers are iconoclasts that aren't bound up in social conditioning. If you happen to value what society values, that's fine, but ground it internally, not externally. There is a big difference between believing that there is a God because someone planted the idea in your head versus you deriving the idea independently.

Many people have destroyed their lives by getting caught up in false or negative social conditioning. Fix all of the following bad social conditioning:

- Religious indoctrination â€” Watch out for silly, outdated notions about science, history, politics, human behavior, and morality. Not everything religious is bad, but even a good idea adopted thoughtlessly, dogmatically, becomes a liability.

- Pseudo-science â€” Watch out for conspiracy theories, UFOs, miracles, paranormal, ESP, telepathy, clairvoyance, creationism, alternative medicine, fad diets and nutrition advice, psychoanalysis, detoxing, astrology, cryptozoology, dream interpretation, etc.

- School â€” Watch out for false/outdated knowledge, partial knowledge, ineffective learning techniques, misguided values, government propaganda, etc.

- Popular culture â€” Watch out for cultural myths, over-simplifications, two-party system, stories, news reports, cultural values, being normal, ideas of right/wrong, heroes, villains, social goals, social priorities, judgments, taboos, etiquette, government propaganda, military propaganda, standards for behavior, fairy tales about sex and relationships, etc.

- Popular science â€” Watch out for old theories of psychology, entrenched medical treatments, etc.

- Parents â€” Identify and deal with disempowering thinking that your parents might have instilled in you.

- Friends â€” Watch out for peer pressure, upholding a false image, loyalty to negative or abuse people, etc.
