    - [[Executable strategy for writing]]
- Epistemology, originality
    - [[Use notes to avoid preconceived conclusions]]
    - [[Leaps of insight emerge from prior thought]]
    - [[Brainstorming may often substitute for missing insight accretion systems]]
    - [[Prefer associative ontologies to hierarchical taxonomies]]
    - [[Evergreen notes are a safe place to develop wild ideas]]
- Morale:
    - responding to authentic interest and thought instead of thinking “I should write about X”
    - no more “what should I write about?”
