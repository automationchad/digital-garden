Future cashflows

Your valuations will not come from your ability to get new customers. Instead, your valuation will come from how *many ways* you can get new customers. It's the diversity here that maximizes your multiple. Why is this? Because when people buy a business, they're looking for certainty. Ten ways to grow a business is more "certain" that only one way to grow a business. It's more of a question of certainty of future cash flow than the amount of future cash flow.

**The definition of unhealthy scale is when growth of the business violates the certainty of the future of the business**

See [[Scaling badly can kill authenticity]].

Thus the market cap of a business is the equilibrium point at which the increase in profits is no longer worthy of the increased risk exposure. Itâ€™s when growing a business past its current level incurs more risk than benefit.

In my mind, this is where you put the humans you serve at risk.

The good scale protects the reputation as it grows. You want to turn the growth of your business into a multiplier. As the business grows, it becomes more respected and better trusted. A lot of business get this backward. They will attempt to grow the size of the business by harvesting all of the goodwill in their market. This is eating from tomorrow in order to hit an arbitrary number today ([[Technical debt]]).
