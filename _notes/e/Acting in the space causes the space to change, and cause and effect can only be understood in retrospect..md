Despite what we initially think about how “straightforward” an automation is, we always need to do discovery on the underlying business process.

With fast growing companies the underlying processes that we automate are likely to change.

This is the land of high-feedback, risk and innovation: generally stuff clients have never done before, anything that the business are unsure about, new technologies, etc.

Sometimes the client won’t be certain about the outcomes they want.

They might know about a higher-level outcome – gaining more customers, or more advertising revenue – but they might not know whether the automation we’re suggesting will actually work.

That’s a **Complex** problem.

OR when you start automating and the requirements / underlying process to be automate begins changing because of what you discover as a result.

That’s a **Complex** problem.

Example here is Molecular Testing Labs where we started off with a fixed project scope and as we started building the underlying business process changed which required us to go back to the original automation and keep changing it.

<aside> 🧠 Ultimately, why did that project change as we automated? Because Molecular were still onboarding to those new tools.

When someone already has the tool for some time they understand it, and subsequently when they want to automate it, the outcomes become clearer.

So in our discovery process it’s imperative we ask prospects: “**How long have you had these systems in place?**”

If the answer is: “**We’re still in the process of getting them**” then you know you’re likely operating in the Complex domain.

Conversely if the answer is: “**We’ve had them for a while now**” then you’re likely operating in the Complicated domain.

</aside>

In this domain, you can look back at what you end up with and understand that it’s much better, but you can’t come up with it to start with, nor can you define what “better” will look like and try to reach it.

It emerges as you work.

Because the outcomes we look for keep changing, we can’t apply our expert practices and expect success.

## How does Motis Group handle Complex problems?

In a complex environment the thought process is you probe, sense and respond.

There’s no point guessing _how_ you’re going to reach the end of the project, because as soon as you get feedback, there’s a good chance the goal itself will change.

It’s better to _**hack something out**_ that can fail safely, _**get feedback on it**_ and _**change the practices**_ we use based on what we learn.
