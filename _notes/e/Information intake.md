Feeding yourself low-quality information means low-quality source material from which to create. Low-quality information makes you reactive, negative, and low-consciousness.

Information in equals information out. If you feed your mind low-grade data, how do you expect a high-grade output? 

If you want to be a creative person, working out of your [[Zone of Genius]], and sharing your gift with the world, you need to carefully control everything that you allow to enter and influence your mind. 

On a practical level this means: no TV news, no cable TV, no negative newspapers, no tabloids, no Facebook, no Twitter, no mindless internet browsing, no gossip, no pessimistic friends. 

Instead, feed your mind high-quality sources of data: non-fiction books, classic literature, documentaries, school, lectures, seminars, trade journals, positive friends, etc.

High-quality sources feed you with information that is: true, accurate, holistic, complex, scientific, psychological, artistic, something you can act on, promotes thinking and high-consciousness, positive, empowering.

Why cut out news?

> "The world of people goes up and down and people go up and down with their world; warriors have no business following the ups and downs of their fellow men."

You need to stop reacting to the other external world. Watching news makes you only more reactive.
