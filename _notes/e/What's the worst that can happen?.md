It’s important to look at how fear works and how it influences your decisions.  Your fears manifest in a multitude of ways that you aren’t even aware of.  **You’ll never reach your full potential unless you conquer your fears.**

**These simple questions have the power to clarify and uproot the most crippling of fears.**  If you’re facing a major decision, or having doubts about a big decision that you’ve already made, sit down and ask yourself:

1. **What’s the worst that will happen?**
2. **Why is that bad?**
3. **What will I do when the worst happens?**

**Viva Las Vegas**

In 2012, Leo was mulling over whether to relocate from Dallas to Las Vegas.  He wanted to fully immerse himself in learning how to pickup women and Vegas had the nightlife to help him do that.  It was one of the toughest decisions he’d ever faced.

Deep-down he was excited at the prospect of moving, but he was also plagued with fear and doubt.  **In his mind, he had painted a picture of things going amazing well or horribly bad.**

There were many challenges he’d have to face: leaving behind friends and family, trying to make his business work in a new city, finding a balance between pick-up and career, the hassle and costs of moving, and making a life change so radical it could backfire.

**Even after all the logical, pros vs cons analysis, he was still left with palpable fear that he might be making a big mistake.**  So Leo discussed this with a life coach who kept asking, _“What’s the worst that can happen?  Why is that bad?”_  It went something like this:

**Coach**: “What’s the worst that can happen if you move to Vegas?”

**Leo**: “I hate it so much that I’m miserable, like in Boston five years ago.”

**Coach**: “And why is that bad?”

**Leo**: “I hated living in Boston.”

**Coach**: “Why bro?  Ya gaht something against [great coffee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSvNhxKJJyU), lobster rolls that are wicked pissa, hot angels who [seduce people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taFCpibjF0M&t=5s) into learning history, and a team that keeps winning the Supabowl, bro?”

**Leo**: “Excuse me?”

**Coach**: “Nevermind…why was living in Boston bad?”

**Leo**: “I didn’t have any friends or family…I felt lonely, uncomfortable and insecure.  But, I want to move out of Dallas.”

**Coach**: “And what’s bad about moving out of Dallas?”

**Leo**: “I’m tired of moving.  I’m frustrated because I’m wasting time.  What if I spend a lot of money and it doesn’t work out and then I have to move back?”

**Coach**: “And what’s bad about wasting time and money?”

**Leo**: “I should be putting that time and money towards advancing my career.  I don’t want to take a step backwards.”

**Coach**: “What’s bad about taking a step backwards?”

**Leo**: “If I keep delaying I’m not going to be successful.”

**Coach**: “And why is that bad?”

**Leo**: “I want to be proud of my life and have it mean something important.”

**Coach**: “So it sounds like accomplishing something important with your life will make you feel proud and significant.  You’re afraid you might lose that opportunity if you move to Vegas. **So, you’re wagering your life’s significance on this move. No wonder you’re second-guessing yourself.**”

**Leo**: “Well, yeah… come to think of it, moving to Vegas and seeing what happens IS the opportunity.  It’s the bold choice that will grow me instead of staying in my comfort zone.”

**Coach**: “So what’s the worst that will happen if you move to Vegas?”

**Leo**: “Well…I might hate it and lose interest in pick-up and find that I can’t restart my business.”

**Coach**: “Okay. Let’s say that happened. What would you do then?”

**Leo**: “I could always move back to Dallas. I’d have to stay in Vegas for at least a year because of the apartment lease term.

“I’d pay about $4,000 to move to Vegas, and another $2,000 to move back to Dallas if it doesn’t work out. So worst-case scenario, I’m out $6,000 and back to where I am now.

“I’m basically paying $6,000 to live in Las Vegas for a year.  That actually doesn’t sound so bad. Even if I realize that I don’t want to live in Vegas, it’ll be worth it to have lived there for a year. $6,000 for that kind of life experience sounds like a bargain!”

**Coach**: _“Sounds like you don’t have as much to lose as you thought.”_

**Leo**: “Guess not. And the upside is enormous.”

**Once you dig into the issue, identify the worst-case scenario, and stare your fear in the face, it’ll give you clarity and breathing room.**  Leo’s true fear wasn’t about moving to Vegas. It was about being insignificant and how wasting time and money would set him back.  **Remember, your mind is really good at catastrophizing** — making you feel fear even when the risks are minimal.

**When you truly see what your fear is about, you will also see the solution.**  Upon closer inspection, Leo realized he wasn’t wasting time and money at all.  He was making a calculated investment into his personal growth and embarking on an exciting life adventure.  As soon as he made this re-frame he was at peace.

**How to Discover Your True Fears and Motivation**

So sit down and really ask yourself:

1. What’s the worst that will happen?
2. Why is that bad?
3. What will I do when the worst happens?

- Go deep on this.  **Keep digging until you hit rock-bottom and have an “Ah-ha!” moment**, especially with #2.  You’ll learn a lot about yourself.  If you go deep enough **you will discover your deepest underlying fears and your deepest source of motivation.**

In the Vegas example, Leo discovered that his deepest fear was wasting his life, and his deepest motivation was living a meaningful, accomplished life — two sides of the same coin.

- **It’s very powerful to identifying your root fears, because they explain many of your behavioural patterns**. A root fear is a generic, abstract, commonly-held fear that pervades your entire life.  Fears like:

- Fear that you are unlovable
- Fear that you are not good enough or smart enough
- Fear of death
- Fear of going broke
- Fear of letting your family down
- Fear of rejection
- Fear of failure
- Fear of losing control
- Fear of reverting to your old self
- Fear of embarrassment
- Fear of being wrong
- Fear of being insignificant

**Ignoring Fear vs Releasing Fear**

“We gain strength, and courage, and confidence

by each experience in which we really stop to look fear in the face…

we must do that which we think we cannot.”

—Eleanor Roosevelt

The best way to neutralize a crippling fear is to **simply take action.**  The second best way is to **methodically examine it** (not to be mistaken with ruminating on it).

**Examination forces you to face your fears and see that they are largely figments of your imagination**. Sometimes just seeing the fear for what it is — even if it’s very real — will give you peace. You’ll simply release the fear after you see it in its entirety.

When you face your fear, one of several things will happen:

1. You will resist and **bury your head** in the sand. (fail)
2. You’ll see that you’ve **exaggerated** the fear in your mind.
3. You’ll see that the worst-case scenario is **wildly improbable**. And even then, you have options.
4. You’ll see that the fear is **actually about something else**, something deeper.
5. You’ll see that the fear, even if warranted, is **dis-empowering and poisoning** your life.

Choice 2, 3, 4, and 5 all lead to a partial or sometimes total release of the fear, giving you a sense of ease and allowing you to act from a position of clarity.  Choice 1 will prolong your suffering and could lead to all sorts of real-world and psychological problems.

**All neurotic behavior comes from trying to sweep fear under the rug** and running away or avoiding your problems. Parts of you are incredibility adept at shirking responsibility. It’s your job to stay vigilant.

**Not Digging Deep Enough**

You want to go through at least five iterations on the _“And, why is that bad?”_ question.  The most common mistake you can make when exploring your fears is not digging deep enough.

**Make sure you’re specific about what upsets you the most about the situation.** Don’t give generic answers like, _“It will suck.”_  How will it suck?  Why will it suck?  _“It will suck because I’ll feel bad.”_ Not specific enough!  What are you actually going to feel?  Name emotions (sad, mad, glad, scared, ashamed, disgusted, lustful, etc).

Always be sure to ask, **“What’s bad about feeling that?”**  Make sure you dig deep.

Sometimes this is easier said than done. It’s especially tough in serious situations like a death in the family, a cancer diagnosis, losing your life savings in the stock market, etc. **Tough situations definitely make it harder to exert conscious control, but the same fear-busting strategy applies** — you’ll just need to summon more courage to use it.

>“The whole secret of existence is to have no fear. Never fear what will become of you, depend on no one. Only the moment you reject all help are you freed.” —Buddha

- **The point isn’t to dismiss all your fears as nonsense.**  Everyone knows that **worst-case scenarios sometimes come true.** You can lose your kid; you can lose a parent; you can end up broke; your spouse can get cancer; you can be abandoned by your partner, or you can die tomorrow.  This is going to sound harsh, but **that’s life!**

- You don’t choose these things. **You can only control how you think about them.** Comfort yourself only as much as you need to, then choose to think in an empowering way.  **If you make yourself a victim and choose to think in a dis-empowering way, you will get results you don’t want to have.**

- eg:  Are you worried about losing your kid to the point where you might be over-protective?  **Are you perhaps doing more harm than good?**
    -     The key issue isn’t about protecting your kid. It’s about why YOU feel the need to be so protective.  Are you really doing it for your kid’s benefit or for yours? Be honest!  Parents sometimes overprotect their kid to calm their own anxiety, even when it’s destructive to the child.
    -     **What if you just accepted the fact that your kid could die?**  It’s the truth isn’t it?  You will die.  Your kids will die.  Everything you cherish will eventually be incinerated when the sun expands to vaporize the Earth a few billion years from now.

> “My heart is afraid it will have to suffer. Tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself." —Paulo Coelho

- **The worst case scenario is always death or massive pain**.  Death isn’t so bad.  The sooner you can let go of this fear, the sooner you can move on to living a content life.  Massive pain is harder to let go of.  But still, **for most situations, the fear of massive pain is greatly over-exaggerated.**

- **Consider this: your life is never made worse by facing reality**. But you have the potential to really screw your life up badly if you insist on sticking your head in the sand.  Perhaps it’s time to dig in and look at your fears square in the face.

**A Caution on Identifying Fears**

In the hands of an emotionally stable individual, this technique can be very effective. **In the hands of an emotionally broken individual, this technique will make things worse.**

When you dig into your fears, **a common mistake is to come up with unlikely worst-case scenarios**.  Watch out for this especially if you tend to be habitually negative or catastrophize a lot.  You need to **find** **realistic** **worst-case scenarios!**  Don’t get trapped in gloom-and-doom thinking.

- eg: Leo moving to Vegas.
    -     Unlikely worst-case scenario: _“I die in a horrible car wreck while driving to Vegas.  I get skin cancer from the scorching Vegas sun.  I get food poisoning at the Bellagio brunch buffet and die.  I watch a Cirque Du Soleil show and one of the acrobats falls on my head…”_
    -     Realistic worst-case scenario:  _“I can’t restart my business in Vegas.  I can’t balance the demands of pickup with my career.  I lose interest in pick-up.  I get lonely because my friends and family are in Dallas.  I realize I was wrong about Boston, because it’s actually the best place in the galaxy and I could’ve been living there this whole time!_ ?_”_

**We’re interested in an apples-to-apples assessment.  You don’t want to fixate on freak accidents.**  Although freak accidents could happen anywhere, you want to focus on plausible scenarios.  Always remember to ask, _“How likely is this to really happen?”_  This will keep the worst of the worst-case scenarios at bay.

**It’s also helpful to do this exercise with a coach**. A good coach will prevent you from spiralling down into unrealistic negative thinking.

**Examination vs. Negativity**

Examining your fears is not the same thing as pessimistic thinking.  **Examination empowers, while negativity dis-empowers.**

Examination is an inner game tool to be used consciously, for limited periods of time, to dissolve bothersome situations, which leaves you feeling strong.

Negative, pessimistic thinking is a neurotic tendency — an obsessive, unconscious compulsion.  It can drag out for hours and exaggerate problems, which leaves you feeling helpless.
