An over reliance on metrics can lead us to disproportionately value the things that are easiest to measure.

> Those who believe that what you cannot quantify does not exist also believe that what you can quantify, does -- Aaron Haspel

Concept: [[Metric fixation]]

Note: Metrics are not instrinsically tyrannical, it's that they are frequently used in ways that are tyrannical.

Marketing opts for certain options simply because they can be more easily measured.

Logic: "ONLY WHAT IS MEASURABLE IS WORTH DOING"

"Measurability bias"

In regards to IT, the growing opportunities to collect data and the declining cost of doing so, contribute to the belief that data is the answer.

"Juking the stats", "Teaching to the test" (Essentially what I was doing at USC when skipping lectures and studying test problems is an anecdotal example)

The superior surgeon uses his superior judgement to steer clear of any situation that might test his superior ability -- aka "creaming"

Gaming is only one class of problem that inevitably arises when using performance metrics as basis for reward or sanction.

There are things that can be measured. There are things that are worth measuring. But what can be measured is not always what is worth measuring; what gets measured may have no relationship to what we really want to know. The cost of measuring may be greater than the benefits. The things that get measured may draw effort away from the things we really care about. And measurement may provide us with distorted knowledge - knowledge that seems solid but is actually deceptive.

Accountability ought to mean being help responsible for one's actions. But by linguistic slieght of hand, accountability has come to mean demonstrating success through standardized measurment, as if only that which can be counted really counts.

> Not everything can be counted counts, not everything that counts can be counted. -- *Albert Einstein*

**The most characteristic feature of metric fixation: the aspiration to replace judgement based on experience with standardised judgement.**
