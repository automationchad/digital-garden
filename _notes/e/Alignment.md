Align all aspects for your life to your values, strengths, and purpose. Align your personality. Align your humor. Align your job. Align your relationship. Align your exercise. Align your diet. Align your city and country. Align your business. Align your recreation time. Align the media you consume. Align how you act in public with who you are.
