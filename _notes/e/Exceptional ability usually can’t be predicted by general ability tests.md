- “Creativity ratings” of professional architects, mathematicians, and scientists, assigned by a survey of professors, were not significantly correlated with IQ ({MacKinnon}, {1968}). However, entering these professions seems to require high IQ: {98%} of the {140} people covered by the study had IQs in the range {118}-{140}.
- Master-level chess skill doesn’t seem to be associated with the results of psychometric tests in adults (see review in Grabner et al, 2006)
    - … though they are in children!
    - And there have been only a few, low-sized studies of this association.
- Musical ability is weakly correlated with psychometric tests (see review in Shuter-Dyson, 1968, p. 308-311)
    - This data mostly concerns broad populations, rather than people of exceptional ability.
- Acquired skill in touch typing can’t be predicted from pertaining aptitude tests

This evidence bears on [[To what extent is exceptional ability heritable?]] to the extent that performance on the constituent ability tests is heritable.
