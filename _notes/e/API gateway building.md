The phrase "data integration" and "automation" often serves as a catch-all term that encompasses a myriad of meanings. 

While the industry extols the virtues of a "single pane of glass" view where all your essential data is consolidated into one window, the practical application of these concepts might remain nebulous for you.

Here at [[Motis Group]], we want to demystify these terms and provide a more precise framework that explains our approach to data integration.

So, what exactly are these integrations we're constructing?

The keyword is "Interoperability." Itâ€™s the technical scaffolding that enables disparate software systems to communicate effectively. APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) function as the conduit for this dialogue, although the structure of each API can vary considerably. This is where "field mapping" enters the equation; it serves as the translator between different API structures.

But interoperability isn't just about translation; it's also about logic. The logic directs where each piece of data should land. Each logical route can be considered a micro-service, orchestrated by route handlers that dictate what happens when a specific route is accessed.

As users engage with one or multiple front-end interfaces, we link those actions to corresponding back-end systems. Therefore, we can redefine "data integration" as essentially an advanced data routing mechanism.

In terms of implementation, we utilize Tray as the middleware to construct this API gateway. We offer a subscription model, charging a monthly fee based on the volume of API calls routed through the system.

So, when you think of data integration and automation, consider it as an intricate dance of data and logic, facilitated by the sophisticated routing systems we build.
