>"Technology democratizes consumption but consolidates production. The best in person in the world at anything, gets to do it for everyone." â€” Naval Ravikant

Technology has created a disintermediation of labor. Availability of your energy and skills are no longer constrained by a middleman (employer or agency). Much like blockchain aims towards decentrilization of a network, we as humans have become decentralized.

Software is a self-contained system, and so are we. The principles that make software useful are eerily similar to what makes us valuable as individuals. Break it down, and any system has two core elements:

1. [[Functional requirements]]: the **what**â€”your skills, know-how, and real-world chops. That's your persona, and it better be rock-solid ([[Persona capitalizes on opportunities]]). Stop messing around with cutesy gimmicks ([[Resistance]])â€”your offering and workflow should be crystal clear. No BS. This sets the stage for seamless marketing ([[Anti-marketing]], [[Preselection creates opportunities]]) and intuitive UX ([[Make it easy for people to interact with you]]).
2. [[Non-functional requirements]]: the **how**â€”your reliability in delivering said skills. These are your lagging indicators ([[Lagging indicators]]), the silent factors that dictate whether people stick with you or bail ([[Personality maintains opportunities]]).

- Shoddy scalability that leads to downtime? Expect churn.
- A UI that's a maze? Same story.

In essence, you're an API in this vast human network. Your unique talents and outputs are modular components, ready to supercharge another entityâ€”be it a person, business, or an idea.

Q: **How important are non-functional requirements really?** Reason I ask that is because they're are plenty of examples where people have focused on the functional requirements and have been successful.

A: Your definition of "success" needs a reality check. Quick rise and quicker fall? Not my idea of success. Longevity is the game. The only way to sustain your functional prowess is to build it on a bedrock of robust non-functional attributes.
