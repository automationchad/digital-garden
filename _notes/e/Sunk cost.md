#### Sunk Cost and Prospective Cost

Sunk costs refer to expenditures that have already been committed and cannot be recovered. They stand in contrast to prospective costs, which are potential future outlays that can still be avoided. In rational decision-making models, only these prospective costs should be considered relevant.

#### Classical Economic Theory on Rational Decision-Making

According to the tenets of classical economics and microeconomic theory, rational decisions should solely focus on current options and their future consequences. In other words, past expenses, or sunk costs, are irrelevant to the decision at hand and are best considered "water under the bridge."

#### Real-World Behavior: Sunk Cost Fallacy

However, the theoretical principle often diverges from real-world behavior. People frequently allow their past investments—be it financial, temporal, or emotional—to guide their future actions. This propensity to keep investing in a losing proposition just because one has previously invested in it is known as the "sunk cost fallacy." Phrases like "throwing good money after bad" encapsulate this irrational behavior.

#### Psychological and Social Influences

Various factors contribute to the sunk cost fallacy:

- **Framing Effects**: This cognitive bias causes people to make decisions based on the positive or negative presentation of options. When options are framed positively, individuals tend to be risk-averse, but they seek risks when framed negatively.
