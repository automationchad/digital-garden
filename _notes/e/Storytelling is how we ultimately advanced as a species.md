> Memory of past mistakes and the ability to plan for the future is how we became an apex predator.

The art of storytelling is not merely an exercise in entertainment or artistic expression; it is intrinsically tied to the evolution and progress of humanity. This unique capability of humans to conceptualize, narrate, and share experiences has been pivotal in shaping our collective journey, from survival strategies to the intricate web of modern societies.

Consider the early days of our species. Before the abstraction of written language or digital communication, the tribal lore was transmitted orally. The image of a future event, such as hunting a mammoth, wasn't just a fleeting thoughtâ€”it was a vision of tomorrow that had to be communicated effectively to others. To relay the details of the hunt, the roles each individual would play, the strategies to employ, and the risks involved, required a narrative. This narrative not only contained factual information but often incorporated emotions, aspirations, and collective goals.

Through storytelling, humans could engage in what some term as 'mental time travel', exploring possible futures and preparing for them. This forward-thinking capability allowed for advanced planning and coordination. Without the power of storytelling, it's arguable that collective tasks requiring elaborate planning, like mammoth hunts, would have been near impossible.

Moreover, storytelling acted as the primary tool for preserving collective memory, values, and norms. These narratives, passed down through generations, created a shared understanding and a sense of identity, enabling stronger societal bonds.

In essence, the ability to weave and comprehend stories became an evolutionary advantage, guiding humans through challenges and pushing the boundaries of what was deemed possible. As we've advanced, this primordial tool has only grown in significance, shaping cultures, fueling innovations, and driving civilizations forward.
