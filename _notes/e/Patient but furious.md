"Gradatim Ferociter" - Motto of blue horizon

**step by step, ferociously**

Acting with speed and not haste, there should always be a bias towards action, but always the right action never take action quickly that conflicts with any major values. Will you do the right thing? 

Even though itâ€™s tempting to do the wrong thing? 

People who act with haste tend to conveniently ignore this fact because they believe the ends justify the means (See: [[Communism]], and [[Those who seek to gain from their activity, should also lose when things go wrong]])

Theyâ€™ll do ANYTHING for a quick payday.  This means donâ€™t opt for lower consciousness activities for the sake of a dollar, but it does mean when you know the action to take a new note, arise action to take to have a bias towards pulling the trigger without delay. 

More speed in the RIGHT things, have a bias to action for those right things, less haste on the empty shiny objects.
