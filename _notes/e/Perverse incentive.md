A **perverse incentive** is an [incentive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incentive "Incentive") that has an unintended and undesirable result that is contrary to the intentions of its designers. 

The **cobra effect** is the most direct kind of perverse incentive, typically because the incentive unintentionally rewards people for making the issue worse.

The term _cobra effect_ was coined by economist [Horst Siebert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horst_Siebert "Horst Siebert") based on an [anecdotal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anecdote "Anecdote") occurrence in [India during British rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Raj "British Raj"). The British government, concerned about the number of venomous cobras in [Delhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi "Delhi"), offered a bounty for every dead cobra. Initially, this was a successful strategy; large numbers of snakes were killed for the reward. Eventually, however, enterprising people began to breed cobras for the income. When the government became aware of this, the reward program was scrapped. When cobra breeders set their now-worthless snakes free, the wild cobra population further increased. 

This story is often cited as an example of [[Goodhart's Law]] or [[Campbell's Law]].

When incentives designed to solve a problem end up rewarding people for making it worse.
