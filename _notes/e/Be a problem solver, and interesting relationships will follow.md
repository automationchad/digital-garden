> TL;DR: Be a problem solver. Look for depth, complexity, and genuine innovation. That's how you meet people worth meeting.

I don't enjoy meeting new peopleâ€”simple as that. It's not a social aversion; it's an energy calculation. Most people aren't worth the effort because they're not problem solvers, they're consumers.

See, there's a chasm between the two: problem solvers dissect issues, entertain multiple hypotheses, and genuinely seek diverse input. Consumers? They're just regurgitating what they've heard or liked, operating at a headline-level depth. The devil makes use of idle hands. [[Culturally default behaviors fill spare time with othersâ€™ ideas]]. Waste of time. Why Google something when you can ask a consumer and get the same low-resolution answer?

Here's how to not waste time: apply a filter, a robust one. A friend asked asked how I network. I was blunt. "Only losers go to networking events." It's an inefficient market. You pay a few bucks to meet people who mostly just need something from you. If you're interesting, accomplished, and on the up, people will seek you out (See: [[Preselection creates opportunities]]). And if they don't, you're doing something wrong.

Keep grinding, or you'll fade. Interesting isn't a state; it's a stage (See: [[States vs. Stages]]). Think Steve Case, AOL founder. Still relevant because he didn't stop.

The people worth meeting are also meeting people worth meeting. You benefit, they benefitâ€”it's a reciprocal, ongoing relationship of problem-solving and value creation ([[Working on niche, personally-meaningful projects brings weirder, more serendipitous inbounds]]). No need for facades or games; just be honest, direct, and accomplished. Like attracts like ([[Persona capitalizes on opportunities]]).

Lastly, exclusive groups with paywalls can help, but they're not the endgame. They filter out some noise but also introduce their own issuesâ€”like sociopaths leveraging social accreditations (See: [[Â§Cult psychology]]). Use them wisely, or not at all.
