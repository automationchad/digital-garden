_Evergreen notes_ are written and organized to evolve, contribute, and accumulate over time, across projects. This is an unusual way to think about writing notes: [[Most people only take transient notes]]. That’s because these practices aren’t about writing notes; they’re about effectively developing insight: [[“Better note-taking” misses the point; what matters is “better thinking”]]. When done well, these notes can be quite valuable: [[Evergreen note-writing as fundamental unit of knowledge work]].

It’s hard to write notes that are worth developing over time. These principles help:

- [[Evergreen notes should be atomic]]
- [[Evergreen notes should be concept-oriented]]
- [[Evergreen notes should be densely linked]]
- [[Prefer associative ontologies to hierarchical taxonomies]]
- [[Write notes for yourself by default, disregarding audience]]

This concept is of course enormously indebted to the notion of a [[Zettelkasten]]. See [[Similarities and differences between evergreen note-writing and Zettelkasten]].

## Implementing an evergreen note practice

- [[A reading inbox to capture possibly-useful references]]
- [[A writing inbox for transient and incomplete notes]]
