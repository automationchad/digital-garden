If the machine age was directed solely with the intention of making the common people physically comfortable, in a mega productive computer controlled epoch, we could soon all live like millionaires. But such a scenario would undermine the very structure of a hierarchical society, and that's not what those in power want. The ruling class fears a leveling of the social landscape that technology could facilitate, more than they fear any external ideological threats. Their objective is control, not general well-being.

Technology, in their hands, serves as an opiate for the masses rather than a tool for collective elevation. Because if wealth and comfort become the norm rather than the exception, then the most blatant form of inequality vanishes. If everyone is wealthy, then wealth itself loses its distinguishing power.

The narrative around man-made global warming serves as a case in point. It's leveraged by elites and corporations who profit immensely from the status quo while preaching austerity to the rest of us. They advocate for measures that keep developing nations impoverished, all in the name of environmental stewardship.

The ruling class's strategy goes beyond economic manipulation; it's a comprehensive psychological campaign. Through media, they've normalized a range of behaviors that serve to undermine societal cohesion: casual sexual relationships, victimhood culture, and the glorification of unhealthy lifestyles, to name a few. It's a divide-and-conquer strategy aimed at weakening collective identity and empowerment.

At its core, this is a battle for the mind, a psychological war waged through propaganda and social engineering. From targeting traditional masculinity to exploiting identity politics, the aim is societal fragmentation. The playbook is clear: first, influence the women through movements like modern feminism, mobilize the youth through causes like climate activism, and the rest of society will follow suit.

In this age of mass hysteria and tribalism, the ruling class maintains its grip on power not by offering solutions, but by perpetuating problems. And so long as they can keep society fractured and focused on internal squabbles, they can continue to rule unchallenged.

> No society wants you to become wise: it is against the investment of all societies. If people are wise they cannot be exploited. If they are intelligent they cannot be subjugated, they cannot be forced in a mechanical life, to live like robots. They will assert their individuality. They will have the fragrance of rebellion around them. They will like to live in freedom. Freedom comes with wisdom, intrinsically. They are inseparable, and no society wants people to be free. The communist society, the fascist society, the capitalist society, the Hindu, the Mohammedan, the Christian — no society — would like people to use their own intelligence because the moment they start using their intelligence they become dangerous — dangerous to the establishment, dangerous to the people who are in power, dangerous to the ‘haves’; dangerous to all kinds of oppression, exploitation, suppression; dangerous to the churches, dangerous to the states, dangerous to the nations. In fact, a wise man is afire, alive, aflame. But he cannot sell his life, he cannot serve them. He would like rather to die than to be enslaved.” ~ Osho

The U.S. often exhibits:

1. A reluctance towards technological advancement, and
2. A refusal to embrace risk.

This impedes genuine progress. A prevailing notion has emerged: halt progress if any negative arises. Yet, when evaluating new technologies, we should expedite the integration of beneficial innovations. Resistance to progress often stems from:

1. An innate fear of the unknown, and
2. Established players using regulations to quash disruptive newcomers.

This self-imposed stagnation means missed opportunities. Over-emphasizing the negatives of new tech makes us risk-averse, ignoring the substantial benefits that typically outweigh the setbacks. Every advancement entails a price and occasional setbacks. Embracing this is essential; we're not merely preserving the status quo, but seeking the immense rewards of progression. Unfortunately, Western sentiment has veered away from this approach in recent decades.

Opposition to tech and progress is a luxury—convenient for those already in comfort, often reluctant to embrace change that mainly aids society's most disadvantaged. Technological advances, historically, have predominantly uplifted the underprivileged. Yet, the affluent and powerful remain content with the current state. This pattern recurs across sectors like space exploration, nuclear energy, autonomous vehicles, and more. Western societies' dwindling appetite for risk not only stunts our growth but denies potential benefits to the global community. It's disheartening, and one hopes future generations perceive this era as a temporary lapse, prompting renewed dedication to progress and measured risk-taking.
