Purposeful practice, as defined by Ericsson and Pool (2016, p. 14-22), is driven by {specific}, {proximate} goals, with difficulty set to {just outside your comfort zone ([[Skill development requires challenging homeostasis]])}. To orchestrate this type of practice, you’ll need {good feedback}, which in turn usually requires {a coach}.

This type of practice is generally more characteristic of what produces experts; compare to [[Naive approaches to practice rapidly plateau]].

Because you’re always pushing yourself in this type of practice, success requires intense focus. You’ll also have to contend with the problems described in [[Performance plateaus often require a change in approach to surmount]].

One possibly mechanism of action: [Good practice encodes more effective chunk recoding schemes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z3QWwvfYS5exfZE53dKwt7r).
