The creator of an [[Enacted experience]] can induce intense personal connection to a specific experience they have authored. One important consequence: [[Enacted experiences amplify the power of narrative]].

In [Journey](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z3aGFr9R7PZiWNAf4fCLenN), for instance, players can do little but walk forward up the mountain. The sequence of environments they traverse are carefully choreographed so that most players experience an emotional hero’s journey, culminating in rebirth and divine transcendence. It’s not a passive experience: the player took every step with the character. So the character’s ascension is felt particularly deeply.

Great movies and books can be quite moving, but the stakes I feel in those media are nowhere near as intense. I’m empathizing with the characters, but I don’t _become_ the characters. There’s no contingency; I’m not making any of this happen; nothing I can do will change anything.

Social environments can create intense personal connections, but generally not to specific authored experiences.

Likewise, software environments can create intense personal connections, but they’re usually not to specific authored experiences. Snapchat’s streaks are one interesting counter-example.
