When it comes to financial wealth and career building and life at large, [[Acting in the space causes the space to change, and cause and effect can only be understood in retrospect]].

It's akin to venturing into an ever-evolving maze.

Given that our actions invariably reshape this maze, making predictions becomes a Sisyphean task. 

It's the equivalent of attempting to forecast the precise turns of a river while you're still redirecting its course. 

Overanalyzing every potential turn – "Should I strike a conversation with that influential figure?", "How will event XYZ pan out?" – often leads us down the rabbit hole of [[Champagne problems]]. 

These inconsequential dilemmas, though tempting, only serve to cloud our vision.

So, how does one navigate this intricate labyrinth? The key lies in selecting the pathways that broaden our horizons, enhance our skills, and amplify our potential choices.

By continuously enhancing our capability to operate in this complex space, we not only amass wealth but also accumulate responsibility. 

It's a cycle: the more responsibility you shoulder, the more financial opportunities you unlock.

As you scale this ladder of choices and responsibilities, a tipping point will inevitably emerge. 

This juncture, where the abundance of choices starts restricting your efficiency, signals the need to re-evaluate, refine, and refocus. 

[[Good scale is when you have full market share without compromising value]]

At this point you can cut back and re-focus your energy on the core areas that open up more space for the next project.

These moments of cutting back / re-evalutation will form the chapters of your life. 

It's an iterative process of expansion, re-evaluation, and refocusing that determines your trajectory, be it a decision to move countries or simply the next career move.
