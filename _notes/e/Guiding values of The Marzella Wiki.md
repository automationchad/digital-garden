When it comes to managing your digital knowledge, the following are some guiding values and principles to consider.

_Your digital library should:_

1. Be a joy to use
2. Be future-proofed (so your notes are robust, not fragile)
3. Allow for fast and reliable note retrieval (both today and in 10 years)
4. Encourage critical, creative, connective, and generative thinking
5. Encourage active, engaged, and contextual thinking
6. Encourage lateral and metaphorical thinking
7. Allow for the spontaneous cross-pollination of ideas
8. Produce finished products (when desired)
9. Accumulate in meaningful knowledge over time
10. Compound in personal value over time
11. Encourage repetition (repetitions strengthen memory)
