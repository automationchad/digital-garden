> The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is [[fear]], and the oldest and strongest kind of fear is **fear of the unknown**. - H.P Lovecraft

The core tenet of Cosmicism is the insignificance of humanity and Earth in the vast, indifferent universe. There is no recognizable divine presence, such as God, in the universe, and that humans are particularly insignificant in the larger scheme of intergalactic existence.

Unlike existentialism, which also grapples with human insignificance but seeks meaning through individual action, Cosmicism argues that there's no higher purpose or meaning at all. Our lives, morals, and societal constructs are rendered trivial by the enormous scale and complexities of cosmic phenomena.

Key Aspects:

1. **Indifferent Universe**: The universe doesn't care about human lives or aspirations. No divine force is looking out for us.
2. **Incomprehensible Forces**: Cosmic entities, often portrayed as gods or monsters in Lovecraft's literature, are beyond human comprehension and indifferent to human morality.
3. **Human Insignificance**: In the grand scale of things, humans are less than specks of dust, and their achievements or failures don't matter in a cosmic context.
4. **Existential Dread**: The realization of Cosmicism often leads to existential dread and [[nihilism]].
5. **Futile Search for Meaning**: Any attempt to find universal meaning is ultimately futile, according to Cosmicism.
6. **Reality is Inadequately Understood**: Our current understanding of reality is incomplete and could be completely shattered if we ever came into contact with cosmic entities.
7. **Limits of Science**: Even science, which aims to understand the universe, can reach only so far; there are realms that are incomprehensible to human cognition.
8. **Anti-Anthropocentrism**: The idea that humans are the center of the universe is dismissed as a narcissistic delusion.

Cosmicism can be seen as both a reflection and critique of human hubris in assuming the central importance of our species in the grand cosmic scheme. Given your inclination for non-consensus thinking, you might find this philosophy appealing as it fundamentally challenges mainstream ideas about human significance and the quest for meaning.

There's nothing 'out there' that loves you. 

If there IS something out there, it probably just wants to eat you.
