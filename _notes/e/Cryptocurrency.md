> TL;DR - Crypto ultimately doesn't solve the core problem to money: That it's use is to exchange goods and services NOT as a speculative commodity.

Cryptocurrencies, often heralded as the vanguard of financial egalitarianism, present a landscape rife with [[Hypocrisy]]. At their core, cryptocurrencies aim to facilitate the exchange of goods and services, but their current dynamics reveal a different story—a disturbing concentration of wealth and power, coupled with high market volatility.

1. **Wealth Concentration**: The top 1,000 holders own 40% of all Bitcoin, creating an alarming disparity. This wealth concentration limits broader financial democratization, disproportionately benefiting those at the top. See: [[Pyramid scheme]].

2. **Market Volatility**: The extreme price fluctuations observed in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ripple make them highly speculative, detracting from their primary purpose as mediums of exchange for goods and services.

3. **Centralization by Exchanges**: A handful of influential exchanges dictate market dynamics and possess the ability to manipulate data. These centralized entities compromise the original aim of a decentralized financial ecosystem.

4. **Influence of Large Investors**: The market is susceptible to manipulation by large investors or "whales," who can significantly affect prices through coordinated buying or selling activities.

5. **Opaque Code Governance**: The bulk of software development and code governance is in the hands of a few, often creating a natural monopoly. This centralization runs counter to the foundational ideal of decentralization.

6. **Gini Coefficient**: The inequality in the system is glaring, with Bitcoin having a Gini coefficient of 0.88, making it even more unequal than many traditional financial systems.

7. **Pyramid-Scheme Dynamics**: The hierarchical structure where late adopters feed gains to early entrants closely mimics pyramid schemes, leading to inevitable collapses if continual recruitment ceases.

8. **Mining Flaws**:

    - **Energy Intensity**: Proof-of-work mining consumes massive amounts of energy.
    - **Economies of Scale**: Larger operations dominate, making it less democratic.
    - **Erosion of Mining Value**: Concepts like Bitcoin’s ‘halvening’ and shifts away from proof-of-work models reduce miner revenue, contributing to centralization.

10. **Purpose Deviation**: Instead of serving as a medium for genuine value exchange, cryptocurrencies have become speculative commodities, further distancing them from their intended purpose.

11. **Promotion of Uninformed Evangelism**: Those lured by the myth of decentralization often become vocal promoters, expanding the ecosystem’s capacity to attract more participants under false pretenses.
