- Material/money is the desire to be wealthy.
- Mating is the desire for a romantic partner, marriage and family (or some combination of those three).
- Mastery is status and being the best at what you do.
- Momentum is movement: being able to do what you want when you want where you want.

Now write those again but in the order you think you are motivated by. 

This is where you have to put aside any negative connotations you have about all of these. 

It’s okay to have selfish needs, in fact the world needs you have to them! As long as you do positive things to offset them and do good in the world selfish needs and fulfilling them is okay, according to Tai. 

- To know which of these are truly your motivation ask yourself what makes you envious? 
- Which are you most competitive on? 
- If someone has more money, a better relationship, more status, more movement are you envious of them? 

Whichever area you feel most envious in that is your dominant selfish desire. 

Take that desire and flip it to use it in a positive way. Be selfish in that area and you’ll have access to the fuel to drive your car to your ultimate destination and vision. Without it you won’t get as far.
