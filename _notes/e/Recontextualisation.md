Why context is more important than facts.

The underpinning of any set of facts is context. Examples of such contexts include the historical, metaphysical, social, and literary perspectives. What recontextualization offers is a paradigm shift in grasping a situation or fact without modifying the fact itself. One of the challenges with staunch proponents of science, rationalism, and materialism is their blinkered focus on mere facts, often sidelining the realms of spirituality, mysticism, and psychology. They argue that the immutable facts of physics are the bedrock of reality, and thus cannot be contested. However, recontextualization emerges as a tool to redefine our understanding without altering the fact.

The profound truths in life don't lie in the raw facts but rather in the context that imparts meaning and significance to those facts. Interestingly, context overshadows content in importance. Most individuals get ensnared in the tangible facts, overlooking the backdrop - the context ([[The prison of our minds]]). When we believe something to be true based on content, the narrative can drastically shift once we reconsider the context. This reinterpretation enables us to challenge established scientific paradigms without negating the facts and findings.

What truly matters to us isn't just the facts but the overarching comprehension and coherence of these facts. And this coherence is heavily dependent on the aptness of the context. Even with accurate content but an inappropriate context, one's understanding can go astray. But an accurate context with some flawed content can still guide one towards the right conclusion. This offers an avenue to overturn our entrenched beliefs about reality.

Take, for instance, the statement: "A man is jumping... out of a plane with a faulty parachute... in his dream... within a movie." Here, a single scenario undergoes four distinct recontextualizations. If context can perpetually expand, how can one ever claim to have grasped the ultimate truth?

The broader picture or context is crucial. For instance, zooming out of a photograph can reveal why an individual is smiling - perhaps there's a concealed threat like a gun pointed at him.

Science excels at uncovering facts but often falters at effectively selecting and interpreting them. The paramount context lies in the metaphysical domain.

The lens through which you perceive your experiences and your life is seldom acknowledged. It's this intricate web of metaphysical beliefs that forms your context, shaping your interpretation of reality. Yet, most individuals mistakenly equate their interpretations with reality.

Recontextualization can be broadly classified into two types:

1. A sudden twist or revelation without any metaphysical shift. For instance, discovering the unexpected connection between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker or realizing that a childhood bully acted out due to personal trauma.
    
2. Recontextualization that reshapes one's perception of physical reality. This often stems from deep introspective and mystical practices. It doesn't physically alter the world but can lead to profound realizations, such as perceiving every moment as a divine experience or understanding that existence is not bound by the conventional concepts of time and space.
    

It's essential to grasp that possessing the right facts doesn't guarantee an accurate understanding of reality. Science may be adept at gathering content, but it often lacks in providing the right context. A holistic understanding of reality can only be achieved by amalgamating the precision of academics with the wisdom of mystics and sages. Being "awakened" or "enlightened" is about recognizing the overarching context. However, this context is boundless, implying that our scientific endeavors will always be distant from grasping the entirety of reality's content.

A heightened awareness of context can be beneficial. For instance, historical context can shed light on why certain historical figures acted the way they did, given the societal norms of their time. Similarly, psychological context is vital when absorbing teachings, especially in spiritual realms. Not every teaching or insight will resonate with every individual at every stage of their journey.
