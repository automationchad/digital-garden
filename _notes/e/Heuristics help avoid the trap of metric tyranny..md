Avoiding the trap of metric tyranny is crucial. When a business leans too heavily on metrics, it becomes a slave to output, often at the expense of thoughtful input. Metrics, whether [[Lagging indicators|lagging]] or [[Leading indicators|leading]], focus solely on output. But let's get real: output is inherently unpredictable. Structuring your entire strategy around it? Bad move. They can't accurately measure the quality of inputs, most of which are shaped by human behavior—something far too nuanced for any metric to capture. 

What's the alternative? Heuristics. Life isn't a simple equation; it's a complex system (See: [[Acting in the space causes the space to change, and cause and effect can only be understood in retrospect]]). Using heuristics—rules of thumb—lets you navigate this complexity more effectively. It's like [[Operating with a compass not a map]]; the former helps you orient yourself in a changing landscape, the latter becomes obsolete the moment the terrain shifts. They offer a more reliable way to ensure quality input, precisely because they're designed to adapt to human complexity. As metrics are collected, these heuristics can be fine-tuned to better align with desired outcomes.

Heuristics offer a more reliable way to ensure quality input. They're adaptable and can be fine-tuned as circumstances change. When metrics start dictating input, you run into [[Goodhart's Law]]: "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure." Metrics become not just inaccurate but misleading.
