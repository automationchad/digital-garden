When [[Evergreen notes]] are factored and titled well, those titles become an abstraction for the note itself. The entire note’s ideas can then be referenced using that handle (see [[Concept handles, after Alexander]]). In fact, this property itself functions as a kind of litmus: as you develops ideas in notes over time and improve the “APIs,” you’ll be able to write individual notes which abstract over increasingly large subtrees (e.g. [Enacted experiences have incredible potential as a mass medium](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z984ZZLbG4wREM6HAZAovMB), [Evergreen note-writing as fundamental unit of knowledge work](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zR6RRbCfY5rFkiimFnaJZKB)).

Some effective note “API design” techniques: separation of concerns ([[Evergreen notes should be atomic]]), sharp titles ([Prefer note titles with complete phrases to sharpen claims](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zLhoRUyjKU665EY16u4XXJy)), and positive framings ([[Prefer positive note titles to promote systematic theory]]).
