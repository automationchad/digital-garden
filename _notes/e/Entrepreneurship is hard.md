> everyone talkin' about founder this, founder that. this shit is miserable & if you don't agree you're doing it wrong. still, we prevail & self-flagellate. it's proven investors make more than entrepreneurs in sum, especially after adjusting for risks. regular employees, too. why do we do the irrational? ego. to prove you wrong. to be the one who defies the odds. maybe you've tricked yourself into thinking "you want to make the world a better place". that's bullshit. there are 8 billion people, you will have no impact. it's ego. -- Martin Shkreli

Individuals who portray business as straightforward are frequently engaged in peddling business-startup advice—a practice that can border on grift. Promoting theories with an abysmally low success rate (sub-2%) is convenient when all the labor and financial risk is offloaded onto the customer. Operating as an independent contractor (e.g., [[Motis Group]]) may offer more control and leverage but is often a far cry from genuine entrepreneurship or company founding. Therefore, the two shouldn't be conflated.

Contrary to popular belief propagated by serial optimists, entrepreneurship is often less glamorous than working in a well-positioned tech job, at least until you "make it." Even upon achieving "success," your satisfaction can be industry-dependent. Authentic entrepreneurship usually manifests organically. Stories of successful entrepreneurs commonly include:

1. High-performing employees branching out to start their own ventures.
2. Individuals who identify a market gap through personal experience and subsequently fill it.

Entrepreneurship that's solely money-driven, lacking an authentic catalyst, often fails—except for those truly obsessed with financial gain. Another exception includes capital-intensive firms that purchase businesses and then scale them by employing the right talent and strategies.
