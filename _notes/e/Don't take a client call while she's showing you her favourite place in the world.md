It's the decisions that seem to have small consequences.

A client call here. Distraction there.

> Channing Tatum had Jenna, he met her when he was a nobody. She was his ride or die. She loved him for who he was. But he chose fame and fortune over her. Thinking that he could put it off, that he was somehow doing it for her, that the ends justified the means. She hated who he became.

You're deluding yourself if you think your family gives a damn about your "million-dollar portfolio." Skip out on your kid's soccer games one too many times, and don't be shocked when your wife starts eyeing the coach.

We're in 2023, not some nostalgic 1950s bubble. Women are outpacing men in the workforceâ€”because a lot of guys have gone softâ€”and they don't need you to bring home the bacon. They can work, raise kids, and still have options if you're not stepping up to the plate.

You think your business trips, your ritzy conferences, and all that schmoozing over cocktails is "empire-building"? Reality check: All you're doing is laying the groundwork for a lonely kingdom. Your wife isn't a housekeeper; she's your partner in this mad ride.

Marriage isn't some rom-com fantasy; it's about two soulmates doubling as best friends and devoted parents. If you're consistently choosing work over family, you're setting yourself up for disaster. 

A solid marriage can be the ultimate catalyst for personal and professional growth. Stop viewing it as a burden; that's on you and your misguided mindset. Your actions are going to follow your beliefs, so believe in the right things. Make the tough calls, and make them rightâ€”before you're left wondering where it all went wrong like Channing.
