Lovely paper suggesting a key design principle for designing for IA ([[IA vs AI]]): shared representations which can be created by either human or machine. This allows the machine to suggest possible domain actions which can be fluidly adapted/adopted by the user, and for the userâ€™s actions to be understood in the same terms by the ML system.

Contains discussion of a particularly thoughtful mixed-initiative translation interface.

Q. What key principle does Heer (2019) identify for designing ML-supported IA-style interfaces?  
A. Shared representations for domain actions which can be created by either human or machine, fluidly adapted by the former, understood by the latter.
