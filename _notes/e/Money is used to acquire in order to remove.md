Money can buy happiness; anyone who claims otherwise is either clueless or lying. But it's not the things you buy. It's how those purchases remove the crap that's holding you back.

Luxury? It's mostly bullshit peddled by media and pop culture, targeting those who can't think for themselves. Real luxury isn’t accumulating junk. It's about creating a space where you can escape the constant noise. Owning a mountain or a private jet isn't a frivolous expense. It's an investment in your freedom, ensuring you live by your terms, not society's.

Sure, there are cheaper ways to get away—a beach trip, a private house, a rented plane. But owning gives instant solitude. That's the real price tag. Determines if you’re playing someone else’s game.

The bottom line: when you buy, ask if it's amplifying your autonomy or chaining you down. The rat race isn't just about money; it's a cage. [[If you win the rat race, you're still a rat]]. Materialism? It's a trap. The real luxury is anything that strengthens your autonomy, letting you do as you please. So, before that next big spend, cut the crap and ask: Is this bolstering my freedom or robbing it? Choose smart. Freedom’s the prize.
