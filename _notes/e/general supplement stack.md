get off d3 and get on a comprehensive magnesium that is bicarb form with potassium, calcium, and sodium. d3 destroys potassium levels, get sunshine or red light therapy instead. add ginko per other commenter. also methylated b complex. for magnesium blend pristine hydro (has to be mixed with seltzer). b complex probably thorne or pure encapsulations. ginko just find organic and a brand that tests for heavy metals/mold
