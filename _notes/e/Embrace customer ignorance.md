Stop bitching about client ignorance—that's literally why they're paying you. They lack the expertise; you have it. It's a straightforward transaction. No point in getting hot under the collar when they don't know something; that's the job—filling in their knowledge gaps.

Don't mistake this for a free pass to tolerate disrespect, but don't chew out the hand signing the checks either.

Look, a lot of business decisions are downright dumb, especially when there's a skills shortage. The logical move? Upskill. But let's be real—most are too lazy or profit-driven for that. So, they opt for the pricier route: hiring you.

This is where the "stupidity" comes into play. Instead of getting frustrated, weaponize it. They hired you to not just solve problems but also to call out the gaps and blind spots. Do your job, fill the void, and move on. Simple as that.
