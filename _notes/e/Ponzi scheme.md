A Ponzi scheme is a type of financial fraud that entices investors by promising high returns, only to pay off earlier participants using the capital from newer ones. Named after [[Charles Ponzi]], the strategy dupes victims into thinking their earnings are generated from authentic business operations like sales or successful investing, when in reality, it's just a financial shuffle involving incoming investor funds.

The scheme can appear viable as long as it continues to attract new capital and provided that the majority of participants don't seek to cash out their investments, thereby sustaining the illusion of legitimate assets and business sustainability.

For frauds that rely on the constant recruitment of more participants to maintain their payout structure, see [[Pyramid scheme]].
