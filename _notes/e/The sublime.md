The classical notion of the sublime was fathered by [[Immanuel Kant]] in his work _[Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observations_on_the_Feeling_of_the_Beautiful_and_Sublime "Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime")_ (1764).

He defined the [Sublime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublime_(philosophy) "Sublime (philosophy)") in his piece _[Critique of Judgment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critique_of_Judgment "Critique of Judgment")_ (1790) as:

> “an object (of nature) the presentation of which determines the mind to think of nature's inability to attain to an exhibition of ideas.”^[1]

The nature of the classical sublime according to Kant was the sensation produced in the individual when confronted with something that:

1. Was beyond the realms of the mind's comprehension
2. Overawed the imagination

The result was an overwhelming sense of empowerment at being able to stand before such a spectacle and exhilaration at how fragile a person is in the face of such tremendous power and immensity.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_sublime#cite_note-6) Examples for Kant were standing before a mountain or overlooking the raging sea.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_sublime#cite_note-7)

Edmund Burke's (1756) work, "Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful" is another contributor to this classical notion, written at a similar time to Kant. For him, the sublime emerges from the terrible or that which invokes terror.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_sublime#cite_note-8)

#### Arthur Schopenhauer

To clarify the concept of the feeling of the sublime, [Arthur Schopenhauer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Schopenhauer "Arthur Schopenhauer") listed examples of its transition from the beautiful to the most sublime. This can be found in the first volume of his _[The World as Will and Representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_as_Will_and_Representation "The World as Will and Representation")_, § 39.

For him, the feeling of the beautiful is in seeing an object that invites the observer to transcend individuality, and simply observe the idea underlying the object. The feeling of the sublime, however, is when the object does not invite such contemplation but instead is an overpowering or vast malignant object of great magnitude, one that could destroy the observer.

_Feeling of Beauty_ – Light is reflected off a flower. 

> Pleasure from a mere perception of an object that cannot hurt observer).

Watching a dew-laden rose unfurl its petals in the morning light. The colors are vibrant, the form is intricate, and there's no threat to you. You experience pleasure in the simple act of perception, appreciating the flower's beauty without concern for your safety.

_Weakest Feeling of Sublime_ – Light reflected off stones.

> Pleasure from beholding objects that pose no threat, objects devoid of life.

Walking along a rocky shoreline, you notice how the afternoon sun glints off the wet stones. There's no life in the stones, no threat, but the way they interact with light strikes you. It's not just pretty; there's something more, a simple majesty that elevates the experience.

_Weaker Feeling of Sublime_ – Endless desert with no movement.

> Pleasure from seeing objects that could not sustain the life of the observer.

Standing at the edge of an expansive desert, you're struck by its seemingly endless landscape, barren and devoid of life. The desert doesn't threaten you directly, but you know it's not a place that could sustain you. The emptiness evokes a sense of awe, tinged with the realization of your own vulnerability.

_Sublime_ – Turbulent Nature. 

> Pleasure from perceiving objects that threaten to hurt or destroy observer.

Standing on the edge of an active volcano, fully aware of its destructive potential, places you in a state of heightened emotional and sensory alertness. The beauty and awe are inseparable from the risk.

_Full Feeling of Sublime_ – Overpowering turbulent Nature. 

![[Pasted image 20231001184733.png]]

> Pleasure from beholding very violent, destructive objects).

Being in a violent ocean storm on a pirate ship ([[Exploring the uncharted]]). Here, you're not just witnessing nature's turbulence—you're in it, struggling against it, and at its mercy. The ship itself becomes an extension of your vulnerability, as it too fights to stay afloat amidst towering waves and howling winds.

The ocean's overwhelming force engulfs you, offering no escape or detachment. You're not just observing this power; you're at the center of it. The experience would be both terrifying and awe-inspiring, giving you a profound sense of your smallness against nature's grand scale and destructive potential.

_Fullest Feeling of Sublime_ – Immensity of Universe's extent or duration. 

> Pleasure from knowledge of observer's nothingness and oneness with Nature.

Standing on a mountaintop, you gaze at the night sky and, for a moment, your mind grasps the sheer scale of the universe. The realization hits you: you're but a fleeting blip on the cosmic timeline, utterly insignificant yet somehow part of this grand tapestry. The experience transcends the immediate and earthly, plunging you into a state of sublime contemplation.
