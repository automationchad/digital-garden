Lots of people write about solutions to the problem that [[Note-writing practices are generally ineffective]]. The vast majority of that writing fixates on a myopic, “lifehacking”-type frame, focused on answering questions like: “how should I organize my notes?”, “what kind of journal should I use?”, “how can I make it easy to capture snippets of things I read?”, etc.

Answers to these questions are unsatisfying because the questions are focused on the wrong thing. The goal is not to take notes—the goal is to think effectively. Better questions are “what practices can help me reliably develop insights over time?”, “how can I shepherd my attention effectively?” etc. This is the frame in which [[Evergreen note-writing as fundamental unit of knowledge work]] makes sense: [[Evergreen note-writing helps insight accumulate]].

In terms of technology, what matters is not “computer-support note-taking” but “computer supported thinking.”

It’s easy to focus on “note-taking” because it’s a visible component of an invisible practice: if you see someone insightful writing in their notebook, you might imagine that if you get the right notebook and organize it well, you’ll be insightful too. And of course, taking notes is tangible. It’s relatively easy, and it _feels_ like doing something, even if it’s useless ([[Note-writing practices provide weak feedback]]). So it’s an attractive nuisance.

[[People who write extensively about note-writing rarely have a serious context of use]]
