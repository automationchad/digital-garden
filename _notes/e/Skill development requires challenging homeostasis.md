To build muscle tissue, you have to push your body’s homeostatic mechanisms past their normal ability to compensate, at which point your body will strengthen your muscles to re-establish homeostasis. Our neurological structures appear to respond in similar ways, adapting connection networks to make often-used routes easier to traverse (Barnes and Finnerty, 2010).

So if you aim to develop a skill, you need to challenge homeostasis. By pushing into a “new normal” beyond your current comfort zone, your body will respond by making that state easier. At that point, the “new normal” will become the new homeostasis set-point, so you’ll need to push yourself even harder to keep growing. See [Purposeful practice, after Ericsson and Pool](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z9uHnUB5sQeGcEmmmqEGqBV).

## Does ceasing to challenge homeostasis lead to regression?

{Woollett et al} ({2009}) found that retired London cab drivers’ performance at navigational tasks is {poorer than that of full-time London cab drivers, but greater than that of control subjects}.
