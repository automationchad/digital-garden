  
Spirituality and politics aren't mutually exclusive; they're two sides of the same existential coin. Fixating solely on personal enlightenment while ignoring societal dysfunction is a form of escapism. By doing so, you're not just denying the collective problems we face; you're also stunting your own spiritual growth. To achieve higher consciousness, one must engage with the world, not retreat from it.

Let's be real: you can't elevate collective consciousness one meditation session at a time. If those who seek enlightenment distance themselves from politics, guess who takes the reins? Those driven by ego, fear, and exploitation. The unconscious will dictate the policies that affect us all. Your spiritual quest, then, isn't just a personal endeavor but a societal obligation.

Old spiritual frameworks like Buddhism or Christianity offer valuable insights but fall short in addressing the complexities of our modern world. They didn't evolve with an understanding of climate change, social justice, or systems theory. Therefore, their prescriptions for human suffering often miss the mark when applied to today's multifaceted problems.

Ignoring politics maintains the status quo, perpetuating systems that foster inequality and environmental degradation. Engagement in the political sphere, on the other hand, allows for the implementation of systemic changes that can elevate society's collective consciousness and well-being. If your spirituality doesn't equip you to engage with the world's suffering, it's time to evolve it. Both your enlightenment and the world's betterment depend on it.
