> If the only tool you have is a hammer, you tend to see every problem as a nail. -- Abraham Maslow

Myopic behavior is when they care only about short-term results with absolutely no consideration of how a certain action may affect them in the future.

Things are not always as they appear. Often when we solve one problem, we end up unintentionally creating another one that’s even worse. The best way to examine the long-term consequences of our decisions is to use second-order thinking.

It’s often easier to identify when people didn’t adequately consider the second and subsequent order impacts. For example, consider a country that, wanting to inspire regime change in another country, funds and provides weapons to a group of “moderate rebels.” Only it turns out that those moderate rebels will become powerful and then go to war with the sponsoring country for decades. Whoops.

> “Failing to consider second- and third-order consequences is the cause of a lot of painfully bad decisions, and it is especially deadly when the first inferior option confirms your own biases. Never seize on the first available option, no matter how good it seems, before you’ve asked questions and explored.” —Ray Dalio

The ability to think through problems to the second, third, and nth order—or what we will call second order thinking for short—is a powerful tool that supercharges your thinking.

In his exceptional book, _[The Most Important Thing](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0231162847/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0231162847&linkCode=as2&tag=farnamstreet-20&linkId=IVJWRTJOAYFYASKD),_ **Howard Marks** explains the concept of **second-order thinking**, which he calls second-level thinking.

> First-level thinking is simplistic and superficial, and just about everyone can do it (a bad sign for anything involving an attempt at superiority). All the first-level thinker needs is an opinion about the future, as in “The outlook for the company is favorable, meaning the stock will go up.” Second-level thinking is deep, complex and convoluted.

**First-order thinking is fast and easy.** It happens when we look for something that only solves the immediate problem without considering the consequences. For example, you can think of this as I’m hungry so let’s eat a chocolate bar.

**Second-order thinking is more deliberate.** It is thinking in terms of interactions and time, understanding that despite our intentions our interventions [[Iatrogenics|often cause harm]]. Second order thinkers ask themselves the question “[[Filters Against Folly - Garrett Hardin]]” This means thinking about the consequences of repeatedly eating a chocolate bar when you are hungry and using that to inform your decision. If you do this you’re more likely to eat something healthy.

First-level thinking looks similar. Everyone reaches the same conclusions. This is where things get interesting. The road to out-thinking people can’t come from first-order thinking. It must come from second-order thinking. Extraordinary performance comes from seeing things that other people can’t see.
