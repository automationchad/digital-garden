1. Population growth stagnates when it hits the carrying capacity of the land.
2. This results in social stress, lowering living standards and increasing the likelihood of famine and unrest.

4. A demographic collapse ensues (Malthusian catastrophe), followed by the release of free resources, resumption of population growth, and the start of a new cycle.
