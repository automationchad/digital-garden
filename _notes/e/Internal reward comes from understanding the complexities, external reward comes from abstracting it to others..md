> We get joy from grappling with the complexiities; we get paid by abstracting the complexities.

As an expert, you thrive in the realm of intricacies. It's like solving a series of interconnected puzzles that others can't even see. Each challenge adds a layer of joy because it validates the years spent honing your craft. It's almost a form of intellectual hedonism, taking pleasure in the complicated.

The irony is that while you revel in complexity, you earn your keep by making it digestible for others ([[Make it easy for people to interact with you]]). If you don't suffer from the [[Curse of knowledge]], you translate the arcane into the mundane. You're not just an expert; you're a mediator between the world of specialized knowledge and layman's understanding. See: [[Levels of magnification]].
