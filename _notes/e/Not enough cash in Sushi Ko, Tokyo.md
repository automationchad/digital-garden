"We're going to be over."

These were the words that started our dreaded journey.

I incorrectly assumed the amount of money dinner would cost us. Now, I'm short 2,000 yen, with no other cash on hand.

There are some coins back at the hotel, but I don’t recall the exact amount.

Several ATMs are sprinkled around the city. It's 31°C and 60% humidity at 8 pm.

Not a good situation, but luckily, no one suspects a thing.

Yet.

**HOUR 1.**

"Tomiz, you buy some time and eat the rest of dinner slowly. I'll look in the train station for options," I say.

Trying all cards at all ATMs doesn’t work.

Tomiz is eating really slowly.

I try getting a refunded train ticket; that doesn't work either.

Tomiz has ordered another drink (adding to the original cost) so the staff wouldn’t get suspicious.

I even try begging store clerks at a bakery to cash out, but that doesn’t work.

My phone is at 5%. Fifty minutes wasted. No luck.

"Return to base before you lose your nav," a warning echoes in my mind.

My tail is between my legs.

**HOUR 2.**

My turn to buy us some time.

Tomiz says, "I’m going back to the hotel. I will figure it out."

He vanishes into the night, and my phone is at 1%. I'm the only one on the top floor left, alone.

The staff is confused: Will disappeared for 1 hour, returns, and now Tomiz is gone?

I ask for the cheque to not look weird. They bring it. The waitress gives me a strange look. I fumble on my phone to write something semi-apologetic: "We ran out of cash; a friend has gone to get money."

She nods her head begrudgingly.

"Stupid foreigners." Though she didn’t say it, I could feel it.

Tomiz is still searching. Me at the table.

Chefs looking unnerved. The waitress starts wiping down the countertop.

I can't stay here; I'm too in the way. I move to the corner of the room near the toilets. Safe for now.

Tomiz texts: "I’m at the train station now."

I glance at the time: FUCK. Twenty minutes have gone by, and he hasn’t even hopped on a train. Every sentence in Japanese I hear is taken as a potential side comment about me in the corner.

At this point, a tremendous sense of shame and embarrassment sets in. I'm stuck here, and no amount of closing my eyes or wishing for a hole to suck me up is going to solve it. Time will tell.

Staff starts mopping the floors. I can't stay here. I have to go downstairs where I can hear laughter and chatter—maybe that'll give me some cover so I don't stand out too much.

Met with a welcoming gesture from a waiter to go to the front counter to pay, I have to whip out trusty Google Translate to let him know: we're very far from that, my friend.

I ask if I can sit politely in the corner, out of the way of paying customers.

They gesture to a table in perfect view of a giant clock, and the front register where a clerk is eyeing me like candy, eager for me to cough up my bill.

Time has never passed so slowly. I sit there, sick to my stomach, watching the clock go from 9:30 pm to 9:35 pm, to 9:40 pm, to 9:45 pm. No sign of Tomiz.

The waitress comes up to me and asks me what the issue is for the fifth time.

"My friend went back to the hotel to grab the rest of the cash," I say.

"How long?"

"10 minutes," I say, without an ounce of assurance that he’d be there.

"Restaurant closes at 10 pm." I'm very well aware of that fact now—I have been for the past 2 hours.

I can see the manager of the restaurant speaking with the front clerk; they glance my way as they share a confused exchange.

I couldn’t tell what they were saying in Japanese, but it was punctuated by shaking heads and several utterances of "CASH ONLY."

One does not have to speak any verbal language to understand the context and who they were referring to in that moment.

Being at the Hiroshima exhibit, looking at pictures of dead children, is becoming an increasingly attractive alternative.

I open my phone to find some solace in an Instagram post. A text arrives from Tomiz. "If I’m not there by 9:50 pm, you might just have to accept your luck and leave the money and dash."

As quick as the message came in, I’m met with a dark, sweaty reflection of my face as my phone's battery dies in my hands, and the screen turns to black. Reality sets in. At this point, I look to see which waiter I think I can likely push past first in the event of my immediate evacuation.

Then again, they’re probably all trained fighters. And the chefs would probably throw a knife through my hand and pin me up against a wall.

I sit in my shame puddle. At this point, I have deeply dishonored this country.

It's 9:55 pm.

I’ve given up all hope when a lone chef from the back, who is on his way out to go home, looks at the cheque, looks at how much cash we need to cover it, and whips out his wallet, throwing down a fat, crisp 5,000 yen bill.

Who is this savior? I don’t know.

But he’s cooked for me and has probably given me his paycheque for the evening.

A tremendous sense of relief (but still shame because we hadn’t paid ourselves) comes over me.

And as if to reach a climax, from the shadowy streets, a figure emerges.

Absolutely drenched in sweat, his T-shirt sopping wet from the intense humidity, it's Tomiz.

A 10,000 yen bill in hand.

The restaurant erupts in applause and relieved laughter.

The "retard” Americans managed to deliver on the buzzer.

Tomiz throws the waitress the bill, as the chefs throw Tomiz a towel as a prized trophy for his efforts—but equally so, as not to ruin the nicely mopped floors.

"I haven’t stopped running for the past 30 minutes," Tomiz sputters as he catches his breath.

The waitress brings back the change (didn’t bother to check if it was correct) and gets everyone squared away. We waste no time getting out of there.

"Aregato, goi sa mas," I say with a slightly ashamed bow, that was more like a curtsey a court jester would give to the king so as to save himself from execution.

We look straight at the ground and book it out of there as fast as we can.

“How did you get the money? Who do we owe favors to?” I ask.

“I managed to get a cash advance at an ATM on the way to the hotel…” Tomiz explains.

Wow. Any later and we might not have made it out of that restaurant with all our fingers intact.

The end.
