title: Critical mass
---
Originating from physics, the term refers to the smallest amount of fissile material needed to sustain a nuclear chain reaction. In the business context, it's about reaching that elusive point where your efforts turn into a self-sustaining, explosive growth engine.

The concept of critical mass is intimately tied to network effects, where the value of your service or product amplifies as more people use it. Think Facebook or Uber. Initially, you're in a relentless grind to acquire users one by one. But once you hit critical mass, each new user starts contributing to a feedback loop that attracts more users. Youâ€™ve created a virtuous cycle that makes your business model sustainable and increasingly profitable.

But bewareâ€”getting to critical mass isn't just scaling linearly; it's an exponential curve. Initially, you might feel like you're getting nowhere, and that's precisely the point where many throw in the towel. Thatâ€™s a monumental mistake. Unlike in physics, the factors determining your business's critical mass are dynamicâ€”market conditions, customer needs, and technology. This fluidity necessitates that we constantly reevaluate our strategies and adapt. Failure to do so is like trying to reach the speed of light with a mopedâ€”utterly futile.
