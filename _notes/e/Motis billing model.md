The problem is that most consulting billing models places an emphasis on estimation when what we should be doing is the work itself.

Everyone has this aversion to small ad-hoc projects - the hourly model because itâ€™s slightly unpredictable -- they want the big deals, enterprise clients. 

Most of the times these cases are rare. Enterprise companies are no different to small companies, as the work itself gets broken down into teams versus a company wide effort. I suspect this is down to how most enterprise companies do projects -- they already have 80% of the resources, it's the last 20% of the project that's requiring 80% of the effort. 

Great example is Appen's product team not wanting to wait on engineering to deliver for them and so they valued our specialised expertise to push work forward.

In this sense you can stop thinking about projects from a chop the whole forest down, and think about it like they need a very specific tree in that forest cut down, with a very specific type of chainsaw.

It's less about company type, more about problem type.

What options do we have?

- Hourly sessions to troubleshoot an issue live - [schedule here](https://calendly.com/motis-group/1-on-1) 
- Bucket of hours for larger projects - [send us an email](mailto:hello@motis.group) and we'll tell you how many you'll need.

==TO DO==

1. Read into how most enterprise projects are done. 
2. look into enterprise culture.
3. look into how big law firms and lawyers charge for their work
4. Cliff Ennico is a good model to study (solo consultant that has packages and hourly rate)
