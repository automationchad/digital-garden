The issue with projects lies in the consulting industry's billing models, which focus too much on estimation rather than the actual work at hand. This focus leads to a general reluctance towards small, ad-hoc projects that operate on an hourly model; everyone is chasing after large-scale deals with enterprise clients because it somehow makes all the upfront time invested worth it.

However, these large deals are often outliers. Enterprise-level companies aren't fundamentally different from smaller ones in how they tackle projects. The work is still divided among teams rather than being a company-wide effort. What we often see is that these enterprises already have 80% of the required resources in place. It's the remaining 20% of the project that demands 80% of the effort.

Take, for instance, [[Appen]]'s product team, which didn't want to wait for their engineering department. They recognized the value of our specialized expertise to move things forward.

So, it's crucial to reframe how we think about projects. Instead of trying to cut down an entire forest, focus on identifying that one specific tree that needs to be felled, using a very particular kind of chainsaw. In other words, the focus should be less on the company type and more on the type of problem we're solving.
