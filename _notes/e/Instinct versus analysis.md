- Human cognition juggles between instinctual responses, honed by evolutionary biology, and layered analysis influenced by conscious thought and societal conditioning.
- The dynamic between acting on instinct and post-facto rationalization, versus pre-action analysis, varies across [[Loevinger's stages of ego development]].
- Early stages (Impulsive, Self-Protective) might lean heavily on instinct with subsequent rationalization. As one progresses to Conscientious or Individualistic stages, actions become deeply reflective, rooted in nuanced analysis.
