Sunk cost  is a [cost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost "Cost") that has already been incurred and cannot be recovered. Sunk costs are contrasted with _[prospective costs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_cost "Prospective cost")_, which are future costs that may be avoided if action is taken.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost#cite_note-Warnacut2017-3) In other words, a sunk cost is a sum paid in the past that is no longer relevant to decisions about the future.

According to [classical economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_economics "Classical economics") and standard [microeconomic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microeconomic "Microeconomic") theory, only prospective (future) costs are relevant to a [rational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationality "Rationality") decision. At any moment in time, the best thing to do depends only on _current_ alternatives. The only things that matter are the _future_ consequences. Past mistakes are irrelevant. Any costs incurred prior to making the decision have already been incurred no matter what decision is made. They may be described as "water under the bridge", and making decisions on their basis may be described as "crying over spilt milk".  In other words, people should not let sunk costs influence their decisions; sunk costs are irrelevant to rational decisions.

The bygones principle does not always accord with real-world behavior. Sunk costs often influence people's decisions,[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost#cite_note-Bernheim2008-7)[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost#cite_note-Parayre1995-14) with people believing that investments (i.e., sunk costs) justify further expenditures.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost#cite_note-16) People demonstrate "a greater tendency to continue an endeavor once an investment in money, effort, or time has been made".[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost#cite_note-17)[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost#cite_note-Arkes1985-18) This is the **sunk cost fallacy**, and such behavior may be described as "throwing good money after bad",[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost#cite_note-19)[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost#cite_note-Parayre1995-14) while refusing to succumb to what may be described as "cutting one's losses".[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost#cite_note-Parayre1995-14) People can remain in failing relationships because they "have already invested too much to leave". Other people are swayed by arguments that a war must continue because lives will have been sacrificed in vain unless victory is achieved. Individuals caught up in psychic scams will continue investing time, money and emotional energy into the project, despite doubts or suspicions that something is not right.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost#cite_note-Radford,_B._(2017)-20) These types of behaviour do not seem to accord with rational choice theory and are often classified as behavioural errors.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost#cite_note-McAfee2010-21)

## Causes

- [Framing effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framing_effect_(psychology) "Framing effect (psychology)"), a cognitive bias where people decide on options based on whether the options are presented with positive or negative [connotations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connotation_(semiotics) "Connotation (semiotics)"); e.g. as a loss or as a gain.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost#cite_note-37) People tend to avoid risk when a positive frame is presented but seek risks when a negative frame is presented.[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost#cite_note-TandK-38)
