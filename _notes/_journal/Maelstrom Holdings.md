My umbrella company consisting of [[Motis Group]], [[§Real estate]] investments, business acquisitions

[[Terranova Holdings]]

I have strategically acquired companies/systems inside 4 lanes of business: 
- Marketing
- Sales
- Operations
- Finance 

When a company fits our buy box, we run it through our portfolio, and 10x (at minimum) it’s valuation & efficiency.
