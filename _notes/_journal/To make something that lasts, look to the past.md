The new Obsidian icon is inspired by its namesake, the volcanic rock which has been used since the dawn of humanity to make arrowheads, scrapers, knives, and other tools.

We want to make it possible for your digital notes to be preserved for generations to come. While we can’t predict how computers and digital information will evolve in the future, the new icon is a reminder that we can look to the past for inspiration.

Obsidian notes are stored in simple, plain text files, which have been in use since the dawn of _computing_. If you want your writing to still be readable on a computer from the 2060s or 2160s, we think it’s important that your Obsidian notes can be read on a computer from the 1960s.
