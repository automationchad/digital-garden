Here's why groups like Tribe Accelerator are particularly dangerous.

Tribe Accelerator's motto: 'This is a cult that encourages non-cult-like thinking.'

1. The statement is contradictory and doesn't hold up under scrutiny.
2. Even if a group claims to foster "non-cult-like thinking," it doesn't negate the underlying hierarchical structure that often characterizes cults. What they're essentially doing is rebranding and sanitizing the cult-like elements while preserving the core pyramid structure where the person at the top benefits the most.

While they may not engage in overt dogma or ritualistic behaviors commonly associated with cults, the foundational elements are still there: a centralized power structure, a closed-loop system of rewards (usually financial), and a charismatic leader at the top reaping the majority of the benefits.

In fact, such organizations can be even more insidious precisely because they don't tick the usual boxes that help us identify cults. They camouflage their true nature by promoting individuality or critical thinking, but the end game remains the same: accumulation of power and resources at the top.

By removing the more obvious cult-like features, these groups essentially engage in a form of stealth manipulation. This makes them particularly dangerous because they're harder to identify and expose. It's the same old pyramid, just with a new coat of paint.
