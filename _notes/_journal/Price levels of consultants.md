there are four price levels for consultants and you should calibrate your expectations as follows: 

- A. Cheapest: Random guy in Kazakhstan who you find on Upwork. The instructions you have to provide will be so prescriptive that you are basically writing code, but the work will be completed to spec (if you are certain what the spec should beâ€”which is rarely the case). 

- B. Middle: They signal that they can work without supervision but there's a 50-50 chance the project fails. 

- C. Top 10%: Same risk profile as the Middle. You're getting scammed. D. 

- Top 1%: They will save your team 6 months of work and have a reasonable likelihood of growing your company by an order of magnitude.
