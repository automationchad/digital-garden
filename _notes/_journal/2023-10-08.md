Think about this: Their lack of knowledge means they need your knowledge. You can't criticise their stupidity because it's the main reason they hired you. Short of disrespect, don't bite the hand that feeds you. Most biz decisions are stupid -- when they're related to skill shortage. The smart decision would be to train / upskill but most people are too lazy and profit incentivised to do that, so they just hire someone way more financially expensive instead. You have to appreciate the stupidity. When it does appear in your interactions, embrace it, channel it, do what they hired you to do (which is call them out on it occassionally), and move on.

Fuck these kids, what the fuck did they deserve the ribs for? They did nothing. Mexican culture my ass. Fucking free loaders.

2. Create a pipeline of cool females that could potentially be your girlfriend
