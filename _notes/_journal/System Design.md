Intro

This is an introduction to what system design is and what problems we’re solving when designing a system. This boils down to putting pieces together in a way that is scalable, available, and performant.

- **Scalability**: A system often needs to handle large numbers of clients, so the system must be able to handle this load without impacting performance
- **Performance**: A system should be able to respond to users’ requests within a reasonable amount of time (latency) and should be able to handle a large number of requests (throughput)
- **Availability**: Even if one part of a system fails, the system as a whole should be able to continue uninterrupted, even if the system fails while it is processing a task.

Once we've got the  [[Functional requirements]] and [[Non-functional requirements]] we can turn those into a high-level architecture, what services to use, how to configure those services.
