**Hypocrisy** is the practice of feigning to be what one is not or to believe what one does not.

[[Double-standards]]

[[Psychological projection]]

[[Self-deception]]

"So convenient a thing is it to be a reasonable creature, since it enables one to find or make a reason for everything one has a mind to do."[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypocrisy#cite_note-27) [Benjamin Franklin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin "Benjamin Franklin")'s observation has been confirmed by recent studies in [self-deception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-deception "Self-deception").[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypocrisy#cite_note-28)

Humans take a position, look for evidence that supports it, then, if they find _some_ evidence – enough so that the position "makes sense" – they stop thinking altogether (the "makes-sense stopping rule").[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypocrisy#cite_note-30) And, when pressed to produce real evidence, they tend to seek and interpret "evidence" that confirms what they already believe (the "[confirmation bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias "Confirmation bias")")
