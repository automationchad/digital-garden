I keep running into the issue of coming up with a new idea for a service we could offer on top of data integrations through Tray.

Data engineering?

Data analytics?

Cloud networking?

Cybersecurity?

These sound sexy in theory but I always run into two obstacles:

1. My own track record in these skills
2. Market demand for these skills

The main question to answer is: Why can't the company do this with their existing engineers?

What knowledge or skills do most companies not have even with their own engineers?

My hypothesis is that most software engineers at big companies have really good product specific knowledge - they work on the company API, the company database.

When it comes to going meta, I.e connecting that database to any other systems thatâ€™s where it makes sense to outsource that to someone who has platform specific knowledge. 

Throw in Tray there as the tool to do it and it makes you:
1. more credible because you have a devoted tool and
2. engineers will have an aversion of learning the new tool when someone already knows it.

So what are offerings that a consultancy can offer that has a fairly low chance of a software engineer doing / wanting to do at an enterprise company?
