> Most of us were taught to write down all our requirements at the very beginning of the project. There are only three things wrong with this: “requirements”, “the very beginning”, and “all”. At the very beginning, we know less about our project than we’ll ever know again. This is the worst possible moment to be making firm decisions about what we “require”.

We don't know what we don't know.

> Worse yet, when we write down our “requirements”, we act like this is our very last chance to ask for anything. So we ask for everything we can think of, everything we might need. We’re pretty sure we won’t get it all anyway, so let’s ask for a lot and hope we get something we can live with.

What's the solution?

Start shipping. 

> Seriously. Put a person who understands the problem right in with the people who understand how to solve problems, and solve problems in the order that seems most important. Ship everything you do right away. See what the users say, see what the market says. Adjust.

> Are there “issues” with this approach? Sure. You have to be very good to do this. You need to have someone who can take a good guess at what is needed, and a team that can build it rapidly, at high enough quality to give it to users really quickly. And you need to know how to build software that is soft enough, malleable enough, to grow smoothly as it needs to. The technical side of this is well understood. The decision side — the customer side — is not, but waiting won’t make it better. Get the product out there and see what happens.

> This approach shortens all the cycles that delay getting value. It cuts the communication lines between the people who want things and the people who do things. It cuts the communication lines between the people who create things and the people who use them. Take the most important ideas, build them quickly, get them out there.

> Yes, it’s hard to do. That’s why it’s best. Stop estimating. Start shipping.
