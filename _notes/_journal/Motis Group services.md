I keep running into the issue of coming up with a new idea for a service we could offer.

Data engineering?

Data analytics?

Cybersecurity?

These sound sexy in theory but I always run into two obstacles:

1. Track record in these skills
2. Market demand for these skills

The main question to answer is: Why can't the company do this with their existing engineers?

What knowledge or skills do most companies not have even with their own engineers?

Most software engineers at big companies have really good product specific knowledge- they work on the company API, the company database.

- API Gateways as a service (using Tray as backend and charging monthly usage fee)

When it comes to going meta, I.e connecting that database to any other systems that’s where it makes sense to outsource that to someone who has platform specific knowledge. 

Throw in Tray there as the tool to do it and it makes you 
a. more credible because you have a devoted tool and
b) engineers will have an aversion of learning the new tool when someone already knows it.

Everyone has this aversion to small ad-hoc projects - the hourly model because it’s slightly unpredictable. They want the big deals, enterprise clients. 

Most of the times these cases are rare. 

Enterprise companies are no different to small companies, as the work itself gets broken down into teams versus a company wide effort.

E.g when we saw this with Tray with Amazon only having the need for a small license.

I suspect this is down to how most enterprise companies do projects -- they already have 80% of the resources, it's the last 20% of the project that's requiring 80% of the effort.

In this sense you can stop thinking about projects from a chop the whole forest down, and think about it like they need a very specific tree in that forest cut down, with a very specific type of chainsaw.

Less about company type, more about problem type.

==TO DO==

1. Read into how most enterprise projects are done. 
2. look into enterprise culture.

==TO DO==

- look into how big law firms and lawyers charge for their work
- Cliff Ennico is a good model to study (solo consultant that has packages and hourly rate)
	- Hourly sessions to troubleshoot an issue live - schedule here
	- Bucket of hours for larger projects - send us an email and we'll tell you how much

Fee schedule: $250/hr

You will not incur fees until we both sign a written retainer agreement that spells out clearly (1) the services I will perform and (2) the fees I will charge. Flat fees are payable in advance and in full, and an advance retainer will normally be requested when I work on an hourly rate basis. However, if your change your mind and decide not to go through with a transaction before my work is completed, I don’t just “glom” the fee or retainer — instead, I total up the number of hours I have actually worked at $400 an hour, and rebate any excess to you promptly upon your request.

## What we don't do

Some of the things I DON’T do (although I have a good referral network, and can put people into the right hands) are:


## Response Time

Every client is a priority client. I always respond to Voicemail messages within 24 hours of receipt (and usually much sooner than that), and answer my e-mail messages at least once or twice a day, even when I’m on the road. I will always be up front with a client about any limitations on my schedule.
