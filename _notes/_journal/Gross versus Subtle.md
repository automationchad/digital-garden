- gross experiences:
    - going to heavy parties to get drunk and stunned;
    - being addicted to sexual satisfaction;
    - clinging to massive social/media acknowledgment;
    - craving for material ostentation.
- subtle experiences
    - drinking tea mindfully;
    - talking to other person while making full eye contact;
    - listening deeply to the environment and contemplating your breath;
    - walking slowly without any achievements in mind, not even a place to get to.

Gross mind 

**Constantly chases cheap, novel experiences and always needs stimulation**

E.G: 

- Always needs stimulating via technology (Television, internet, etc.) 
- Works too much
- Parties too much
- Drinks too much
- Involves in gossip a lot
- Feeds of drama
- Isn't very present
- Eats unhealthy foods
- Chooses instagram posts over first-hand experience of beautiful moment
- Needs to listen to music always over hearing the natural sounds coming in
- Needs constant sexual stimulation (Strip clubs, porn, chasing girls in nightclubs etc.)
- Blocks emotions (totally out of touch with them)
- A lot more monkey chatter

Subtle mind 

**Can appreciate and soak in deeper beauty, sensitive to all going in**

- Needs little or nothing to enjoy this moment
- Sees the beauty in a lot small things
- Don't want to get to 'there' from here as much
- Chooses reading over youtube, and general internet time-wasting 
- Likes to walk in nature
- Doesn't gossip so much and avoids drama where possible
- Eats healthy foods mindfully 
- Need for relationships isn't so strong 
- Fully feels and is attuned to own emotions 
- Wants to experience things fully for themselves without needing to show people on Instagram
- A lot less monkey chatter
