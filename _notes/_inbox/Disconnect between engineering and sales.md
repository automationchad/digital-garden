Companies literally cannot afford the difference between sales and engineering. Companies of the future will be run solely by engineers a select few who will have social abilities that will lend themselves to negotiate and sell for the company. There will be a very minute intermediary called product which is more of a role than a department and that role consists of prioritising and managing new features. These features will have to be strongly connected to the go to market strategy and it is due to this intimate connection, why we cannot be silo functions between sales and engineering, as soon as you create separate departments, for these, they become disconnected and a intense tug-of-war between the two interviews, which can ultimately be seen and manifested like tray.io. What ends up happening is that you take an incomplete incongruent product to the market with the marketing message that does not actually reflect the products capabilities nor demographic. You also start making decisions that seem disconnected from the reality. Ultimately all decisions should be made with engineering and the product in mind versus any other metric. 

  

What I don’t seem to understand is why is enterprise this holy grail? Why does it represent this saviour of a customer? That’s gonna seemingly save us from the pit of despair that we are in the reason we are in the pit of despair that Warren is not a lack of customer issue. It is fundamentally a product issue , we are not taking the right product to market, and we are not bringing it to the right market, and we are fundamentally missing the point of the software. The software itself should be able to sell itself and be fairly self-serve. Therefore you shouldn’t need a big sales team, if it all You need a great engineering team who great build a great product and can speak to the infrastructure in the benefits, but that’s it

  

Go to market should dictate what features get built and prioritised, not the other way around.
