Before we go further, it’s helpful to define what we mean by Luck, as it often gets used interchangeably with Fortune and Chance.

Here is how [Tina Seelig](http://www.tinaseelig.com/?ref=charlottegrysolle.com), professor of entrepreneurship at Stanford, describes it in her wonderful book [What I Wish I Knew When I Was 20](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6081261-what-i-wish-i-knew-when-i-was-20?ref=charlottegrysolle.com):

- ****Fortune**** is something that happens __to__ you. It is good fortune to be born into a kind family and bad fortune to be struck by lightning.
- ****Chance**** requires an action on your part. You need to take a chance, such as buying a lottery ticket, or asking someone out on a date, to benefit from a chance event.
- ****Luck**** is success or failure __apparently__ caused by chance. It looks like it’s chance because we rarely see everything that has gone before success or failure. Luck is made by finding and creating opportunities. It is a direct consequence of your behaviour.

It’s important to differentiate these terms because there is a clear implication here. ****It’s**** ****easy to assume successful people are just luckier than the rest of us, but that’s a lazy way of thinking. We have more control than we allow ourselves to believe.****

There’s no denying the role of fortune, and life is not a level playing field. There’ll always be someone smarter, more interesting and more talented than you, with more free time and more money. No doubt.

The amount of serendipity in your life is directly proportional to the degree to which you do something you’re passionate about, combined with the total number of people to whom you communicate your ideas.

**1. Blind luck**

The first kind of luck you might say is blind luck. Where I just got lucky because something completely out of my control happened. That’s fortune, that’s fate.

**2. Luck from hustling**

Then there’s luck that comes through persistence, hard work, hustle, motion. Which is when you’re running around creating lots of opportunities, you’re generating a lot of energy, you’re doing a lot of things, lots of things will get stirred up in the dust.

It’s almost like mixing a petri dish and seeing what combines. Or mixing a bunch of reagents and seeing what combines. You’re generating enough force and hustle and energy that luck will find you.

We, as a group, you could argue, got together because of that. [Nenad](https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCmvhCWvHk3-SJqljh5cCm8A) had put up these great videos online, I saw them on Twitter. In that sense, he generated his own luck by creating videos until people like me keep finding him.

**3. Luck from preparation**

A third way is that you become very good at spotting luck. If you are very skilled in a field, you will notice when a lucky break happens in that field. When other people who aren’t attuned to it won’t notice. So you become sensitive to luck and that’s through skill and knowledge and work.

**4. Luck from your unique character**

Then the last kind of luck is the weirdest, hardest kind. But that’s what we want to talk about. Which is where you build a unique character, a unique brand, a unique mindset, where then luck finds you.

For example, let’s say that you’re the best person in the world at deep sea underwater diving. You’re known to take on deep sea underwater dives that nobody else will even attempt to dare.

Then, by sheer luck, somebody finds a sunken treasure ship off the coast. They can’t get it. Well, their luck just became your luck, because they’re going to come to you to get that treasure. You’re going to get paid for it.
