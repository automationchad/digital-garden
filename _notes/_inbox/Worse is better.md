**Worse is better** is a term conceived by [Richard P. Gabriel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_P._Gabriel "Richard P. Gabriel") in a 1989 essay to describe the dynamics of software acceptance. It refers to the argument that software quality does not necessarily increase with functionality: that there is a point where less functionality ("worse") is a preferable option ("better") in terms of practicality and usability. Software that is limited, but simple to use, may be more appealing to the user and market than the reverse.
