Cryptocurrencies—beyond the shimmer of Bitcoin and Ripple—unfold a more intricate landscape. Notably, a startling fact emerged from a recent analysis: half of the initial coin offerings (ICOs) have either withered away or been deliberately terminated.

The landscape is further mired by digital coins that ostensibly appear to be fraudulent.

Market volatility can hardly be overlooked. For instance, Bitcoin's dramatic price oscillations—soaring to over $20,000, then plummeting to below $10,000 within days—are indicative. Ripple's narrative isn't far behind: the January market tumble caused Chris Larsen, its co-founder, a staggering net worth loss of $44 billion, reducing his worth to an estimated $15 billion.

Turning our gaze to the mechanics of [[Pyramid schemes]], these rely on a hierarchical recruitment model. The structure thrives as newer entrants feed the gains of those above them. The profits predominantly benefit the apex, and without continual recruitment, the system inevitably collapses, often leaving the base tier bereft.

Drawing parallels to the cryptocurrency realm, a few patterns emerge. Digital currency enthusiasts fervently advocate for broader adoption. An increase in cryptocurrency investors would drive prices north, invariably augmenting the fortunes of early entrants. A noteworthy statistic reveals that a mere 1,000 individuals possess 40% of all Bitcoin. This concentration suggests that the cryptocurrency's wealth distribution is limited to a small cohort.

Is the cryptocurrency sector then mirroring the pyramid scheme structure? Direct comparison might be an oversimplification, but there are undeniable overlaps. While the crescendo of enthusiasm around cryptocurrencies might suggest a promising horizon, its eventual trajectory—whether it’s destined to be an egalitarian wealth creator or a house of cards—remains an enigma.

The big picture is that crypto has historically been centralized by concentrated cliques of software developers, large investors, exchanges, and miners (perhaps the weakest of this cohort). Developers control the code and most people don't understand let alone read it. Those developers have natural monopoly / network effects that enable their centralization. The gini coefficient for bitcoin is .88 and that doesn't clean the wallets for single owners owning multiple wallets. Large investors can pull of large swings in market dynamics by their coordinated buying or selling, especially when that is connected to network decision making. There's been only about 10 exchanges that have mattered. Their control of the "market" allows them to manipulate data such as literally faking numbers on the screen and wash trading ie recycling customer deposits through the system. How do you know if the market is correct if the market is only revealed to you by 10 CEOs of 10 exchanges? Miners, especially the big ones, have a place at the table but usually end up cost constrained by their break even like business model. Many aren't even sophisticated in understanding the technology. Their value also dwindles as things like bitcoin's halvening happens reducing miner revenue subsidies. Bitcoin and other cryptos want to move away from traditional proof of work mining too. The myth of decentralization was always just that a myth. If you got into crypto for this myth, you were lied to by the assortment of players discussed above to hand over your US dollars to them. Your existence as an evangelist for these schemes expands their surface area for capturing similar victims. Crypto is a pyramid scheme. Pyramids are centralized at the top.
