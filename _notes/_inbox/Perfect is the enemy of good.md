**Perfect is the enemy of good** is an aphorism which means insistence on perfection often prevents implementation of good improvements. The [[Pareto principle]] or 80–20 rule explains this numerically. For example, it commonly takes 20% of the full time to complete 80% of a task while to complete the last 20% of a task takes 80% of the effort. Achieving absolute perfection may be impossible and so, as increasing effort results in [[diminishing returns]], further activity becomes increasingly inefficient.
