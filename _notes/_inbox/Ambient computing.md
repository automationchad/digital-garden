Something in between push and pull: computers are pervasive in one’s environment; they present information in a manner which does not demand attention. You notice things passively, e.g. by walking around.

This term, as used in [[Human-computer interaction]] circles, is an extension of [[Mark Weiser]]’s vision of [[Ubiquitous computing]] emphasizing continuous context-aware personalization and unobtrusiveness via ideas from [[Calm technology]]. It’s not as widely used as those two other phrases, and as far as I know there isn’t a canonical paper articulating this phrase as a distinct concept.
