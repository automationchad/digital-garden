I prefer nuanced thinks over crude things -- humor, dancing. Twerking vs bachata. one is an outright representation of sex vs the other which is more of an intimate experience. Why? Maybe because it requires more work to get to the sex?

Crude experiences are direct, unrefined, and often instant in gratification. They provide a burst of intense stimulation that satisfies an immediate desire. This realm is alluring for a variety of reasons:


### Gross experiences

**Constantly chases cheap, novel experiences and always needs stimulation**

1. **Simple Gratification:** Crude experiences, such as indulging in excesses like partying hard or mindless internet surfing, provide an immediate rush. They cater to our primal instincts – the want for immediate satisfaction without much effort.
    
2. **Escape Mechanism:** They often act as an escape from complex emotions or challenging situations. Overindulging in food or substances, for instance, can numb pain temporarily.
    
3. **Social Validation:** With the rise of social media, there's added pressure to showcase a life filled with "highlights." This often leans into the crude—posting for likes rather than genuine memory preservation.
    
4. **Easier Accessibility:** Crude experiences, like binging on junk food or mindless television, are often more accessible and straightforward than their nuanced counterparts.
