And that’s when I think about real estate

It is not just about owning a property, but about understanding the bedrock upon which it stands.

Real estate is not just about structures; it is fundamentally about land.

A house, no matter how grand, is only as valuable as the land upon which it sits.

This is why the humblest dwelling in California may fetch a higher price than the grandest mansion in Columbia.

It is not about the structure, but the location.

The same materials, the same architect, the same builder, but vastly different values based on the geographic coordinates.

A powerful reminder of the fundamental importance of place.

The question then is not just about whether to invest in the house or the land, but rather, how to enhance the value of the land.

And the answer to that lies in city planning and infrastructure.

This is where the real value creation happens. See. [[True ownership comes from creating something beautiful.]]

It’s an interplay between the Roman ideals of beauty in our creations and an understanding of the infrastructure that underpins our reality.

It means focusing on improving infrastructure, on enhancing the fabric of the city, on making the land more valuable.

It means thinking about how to create a city that is not just habitable, but desirable, a city that not only meets the basic needs of its residents, but also inspires and uplifts them.

This is not a simple task. It requires a deep understanding of the fundamentals, a clear vision of what could be, and the courage to make it happen.

But the rewards can be great. By investing in infrastructure and city planning, we can not only increase the value of our real estate, but also enhance the quality of life for all who live there.

It is this difference in infrastructure, in planning and vision, that sets societies apart.

It is why some nations prosper while others struggle.

It is not just about resources, but about how those resources are used.

This is the essence of value creation.
