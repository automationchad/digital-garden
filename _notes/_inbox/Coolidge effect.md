The **Coolidge effect** is a biological phenomenon seen in animals, whereby males exhibit renewed sexual interest whenever a new female is introduced, even after sex with prior but still available sexual partners.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coolidge_effect#cite_note-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coolidge_effect#cite_note-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coolidge_effect#cite_note-Lester-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coolidge_effect#cite_note-Biopsych-4) To a lesser extent, the effect is also seen among females with regard to their mates.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coolidge_effect#cite_note-Lester-3)

The Coolidge effect can be attributed to an increase in sexual responsiveness, and a shortening of the [sexual refractory period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractory_period_(sex) "Refractory period (sex)").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coolidge_effect#cite_note-Andrew_Colman-5) The evolutionary benefit to this phenomenon is that a male can fertilize multiple females.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coolidge_effect#cite_note-Tlachi-L%C3%B3pez-6) The male may be reinvigorated repeatedly for successful insemination of multiple females.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coolidge_effect#cite_note-7) This type of [mating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mating_system "Mating system") can be referred to as [polygyny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygyny "Polygyny"), where one male has multiple female mates, but each female mates with only one or a few males.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coolidge_effect#cite_note-Andrew_Colman-5) The Coolidge effect has been demonstrated to occur in [humans across cultures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-cultural_psychology "Cross-cultural psychology") and in both sexes.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coolidge_effect#cite_note-8)
