The democratization of technology is why we're seeing platforms now catering towards the developer and having a rich feature of developer tools -- SDKs, APIs, rich documentation, examples, it's all there to help builders build more efficiently.

It's about REMOVING the abstractions, and giving users more control. Ones that don't put up too many guardrails. Supabase, Ironclad, these are all great examples of softwares that put the developer first. Supabase because of their rich tools. ironclad because they decide against "native" integrations, they give you an API and then you decide how to automate between it.

Also another thing to think about:

Most successful tools are built around a base of functionality and then bring together adjacent needs in the workflow to that base. e.g Supabase operates off of Firebase and adds authentication, encryption, etc. On top of. The point is that it's been cleverly done, and each feature they release feels natural, not out of place. They are also modular as well. Everyone needs some form of database, but then some people only need authentication on top of that. The beauty is they only charge you for the features you actually use.

I suspect because they are building to solve their own needs as developers.

So maybe that's the key then: Build for yourself, and then find likeminded people like yourself who buy into that. [[Write notes for yourself by default, disregarding audience]]
