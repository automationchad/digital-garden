In [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic "Logic"), **_reductio ad absurdum_** ([Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin "Latin") for "reduction to absurdity"), also known as **_argumentum ad absurdum_** ([Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin "Latin") for "argument to absurdity") or _**apagogical arguments**_, is the form of argument that attempts to establish a claim by showing that the opposite scenario would lead to absurdity or contradiction.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_absurdum#cite_note-:0-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_absurdum#cite_note-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_absurdum#cite_note-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_absurdum#cite_note-IEP-4) This argument form traces back to [Ancient Greek philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_philosophy "Ancient Greek philosophy") and has been used throughout history in both formal mathematical and philosophical reasoning, as well as in debate. The equivalent formal rule is known as _[negation introduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negation_introduction "Negation introduction")_. A related mathematical proof technique is called _[proof by contradiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_by_contradiction "Proof by contradiction")_.
