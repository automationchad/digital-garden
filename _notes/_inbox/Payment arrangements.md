All of our invoicing and payment strategies are centered around not having to chase people down for money.Â 

For invoices of a certain amount and below, 100% of payment is due in full before work begins.

For invoices above that amount, we're willing to accept terms of 50% in advance and 50% after completion of work.Â 

In *every* case, regardless of how you split or don't split the invoice, there is money due in advance before you even begin the project.Â 

We make it clear to companies that they are NOT on our schedule until they send payment. It doesn't matter how quickly they need the work or how fast of a turnaround time they're hoping for. Our terms don't change based on their timeline.Â 

A lot of companies have payment terms of 30, 60, or 90 days or insist on paying only by check. For us, when that happens, we encourage them to go ahead and start the process and then we can work together 30 or 60 or 90 days from now or when the check actually clears.Â 

In almost every case (and we're saying "almost" to hedge my bets even though we honestly can't think of an exception), brands are able to figure out to pay their invoices sooner.Â 

For invoices that have been split into parts, the remaining part is due *after* completion of work but *before* work is published. That is, once we've finished the automation or the session or what have you, payment is due.Â 

We do not publish work until the invoice is paid, because, again, we *hate* chasing money. It's the genuine worst.Â 

As another part of this, we offer incentives for brands who are able to pay quickly. If you can turn your invoice around in 24 hours, we'll knock off a percentage (like 5%). If you as a client have a history of fast payments, we'll send some bonus content your way.Â 

On the flip side, if you were offered an incentive and then failed to pay, that incentive expires after 30 days and it's not offered again. That doesn't mean you can't advertise with TLA, but it does mean whatever special you were offered no longer applies.
