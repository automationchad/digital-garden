A first pass at my value-level goals for [[Motis Group]]:

### earnestness, ardor, curiosity — not: duty, instrumentalism, grinding

### wu wei, effortlessness, “trust the process” — not: inboxes, graphs, knobs


### diligence, seriousness, agency — not: complacence, passivity, deference

### Another stance: “personality”

c.f. [Minimum Viable Personality - AVC](https://avc.com/2011/09/minimum-viable-personality/)

1. How do you change the customer’s life? (Helps them deepen their relationship with whatever they care about most)
2. What do you stand for? (Meaningfulness, curiosity, diligence, ritual)
3. Who or what do you hate? (Duty, grinding, graphs-up-and-to-the-right, complacence)
