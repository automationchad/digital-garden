Learning resources that are better that business schools: 
- Documentaries on major corporate downfalls (Enron, Theranos, Wirecard, etc)
- Pitch decks from white collar cases (Charlie Javice, FTX, etc)
- Books on kingpins (Billion Dollar Whale, The Mastermind, etc)
- Federal RICO breakdown documents (Google LLC vs Starovikov, etc)
