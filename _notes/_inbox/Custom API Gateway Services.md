## Prologue
*One sentence per pattern that can be expected to precede this one.

[[Integration Architecture Design & Strategy]] Many engineers are great at building, but designing the overall integration architecture often requires a holistic understanding of the business, its goals, and the best tools available. 

## Problem statement
*One or two sentences that summarize the problem solved by the pattern.

- Specific skills for a transient need.
- 

## Discussion
*Anywhere from 4 to 40 paragraphs that illuminate the system of forces resolved by the pattern.

Ultimately what are the integrations that we're building? It's an API Gateway. Users are interacting with one or several front end user interfaces and then we're connecting those actions to some backend systems. So in that sense we can reframe data integration which is an umbrella term meaning a lot of things and get really specific that what we're building is essentially an advanced data routing mechanism. An API gateway, using Tray as backend and charging monthly usage fee based on the number of calls routed.

## Solution
*One or two sentences that tell you what to do to solve the problem.



**Custom API Gateway Services:**

- Develop and manage API gateways, providing a single point of integration for clients.
- Centralize control, offer enhanced security, manage versioning, and provide API optimization.

## Diagram
*A picture or two, hand sketched or photographed, that illustrate the pattern (and sometimes the lack of the pattern).

## Epilogue
*One sentence per pattern that can be expected to follow this one.

[[Migration Services]]: Companies frequently transition between platforms or upgrade their systems. Assisting with data migration, especially with minimal downtime, is a specialized skill.
