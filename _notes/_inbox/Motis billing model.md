[[Estimation is evil]]

The problem is that it always places an emphasis on estimation when what we should be doing it the work itself.

Everyone has this aversion to small ad-hoc projects - the hourly model because it’s slightly unpredictable. They want the big deals, enterprise clients. 

Most of the times these cases are rare. 

Enterprise companies are no different to small companies, as the work itself gets broken down into teams versus a company wide effort.

E.g when we saw this with Tray with Amazon only having the need for a small license.

I suspect this is down to how most enterprise companies do projects -- they already have 80% of the resources, it's the last 20% of the project that's requiring 80% of the effort.

In this sense you can stop thinking about projects from a chop the whole forest down, and think about it like they need a very specific tree in that forest cut down, with a very specific type of chainsaw.

Less about company type, more about problem type.

==TO DO==

1. Read into how most enterprise projects are done. 
2. look into enterprise culture.

Fee schedule: $250/hr

You will not incur fees until we both sign a written retainer agreement that spells out clearly (1) the services I will perform and (2) the fees I will charge. Flat fees are payable in advance and in full, and an advance retainer will normally be requested when I work on an hourly rate basis. However, if your change your mind and decide not to go through with a transaction before my work is completed, I don’t just “glom” the fee or retainer — instead, I total up the number of hours I have actually worked at $400 an hour, and rebate any excess to you promptly upon your request.
