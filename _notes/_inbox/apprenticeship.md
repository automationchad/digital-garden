A viable path seems to be: do something unscalable but guarantees payment then step into something scaleable that does not guarantee payment How this can look: Guys first gig is something like a Jr Copywriter for a team crushing the affiliate game Learns that game with hands on experience then gets into the affiliate game himself Does well there then takes the next leap of running his own offer The scaleability increases each step and so does the risk & skill level required Another example is the sales route SDR. Then moves up to AE. Becomes top performer there Can do some consulting as his side hustle setting up his proven lead gen systems for smaller businesses/start-ups Does well with that. Can potentially go full-time with that or keep it a side hustle. Then a next step could be acquiring a small biz in his industry of experience and using his validated sales processes to scale it Like the affiliate example above. It increases in scaleability & risk gradually as skill level increases.

Well positioned tech bros have a better quality of life & more $ than majority of entrepreneurs Entrepreneurship sucks until you 'make it' & even when you make it, depending on the industry, it still might suck The propaganda campaigns of grifters have made people delusional Entrepreneurship should be a natural calling that unfolds organically. This is a common theme in stories of those who make it big - Guy was a top performer in a company then decides to go and do it himself - Someone was dealing with a issue, a product didn't exist to resolve it, he makes it for himself, friends start asking him about it, he starts selling it Getting into entrepreneurship without that catalyst, solely to make money is often a losing recipe. I've only seen it work with guys who are obsessed with money and are money driven The other exception to this are firms with massive capital that buy businesses and pay the right people to scale them These firms typically copy what's working and try to annihilate the competition with massive spending So you're either somebody that brings capital to the game, or you're somebody that's bringing some sort of necessary value that fills a gap in the market Pulling up to the game because you're broke, want cash, and are too lazy to work is a extremely low probability formula
