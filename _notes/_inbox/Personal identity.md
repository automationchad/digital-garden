Potential year/number of importance: 2/6/63

2/6/2063 - The year I turn 66.

You’re meant for the underworld. Like Trevor Belmont in Castlevania. You will fall in love with a down to earth girl - she understands your task at hand. Understands you must work for the salvation of the underworld.

But don’t expose her to the role, it will scare and scar her mind. Hades’ junior is ultimate goal, helping Hades with the operations of the underworld.

Not heaven angel supermodel.

You are the coolest 2nd tier person that you can hang with 1st class people. 

Top of the 2nd group in class and status.

Levels to the game:

1. God - Purple
2. Heaven - light blue Color theme
3. Club - rich elite, don’t like them. (dark blue)
4. Earth - this is where you vibe (Earthy brown)
5. Green Underworld - This is where you vibe.
6. Hell (Red)- sometimes deal with this area.
7. Pure Evil (Black) - this is like Death in Castlevania must sacrifice everything like Trevor did to beat it. Must die to be reborn and beat Death.

Do entertainment (comedy / music) for the rich (club level).

Do advising on the earth level (boring, agriculture, mining) to the heaven level.

Head of the mining, worker class.

Mega underworld performer for heaven elite

Haley is in the rich group. Not your type. You like earth girls. End it with her.

Lean into to history to guide you. Use history to guide you through life.
