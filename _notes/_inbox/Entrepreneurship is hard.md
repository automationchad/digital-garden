> everyone talkin' about founder this, founder that. this shit is miserable & if you don't agree you're doing it wrong. still, we prevail & self-flagellate. it's proven investors make more than entrepreneurs in sum, especially after adjusting for risks. regular employees, too.

Individuals who portray business as straightforward are frequently engaged in peddling business-startup adviceâ€”a practice that can border on grift. Promoting theories with an abysmally low success rate (sub-2%) is convenient when all the labor and financial risk is offloaded onto the customer. Operating as an independent contractor (e.g., [[Motis Group]]) may offer more control and leverage but is often a far cry from genuine entrepreneurship or company founding. Therefore, the two shouldn't be conflated.
