### Two Categories of Cashflow

- Current cashflow
- Future cashflow

Current is simply the income you have now, and it is transactionally complete and done. Future is the type of income that is yet to be converted. Or it’s in your head. Or it hasn’t been thought up or properly accounted for.

Current cashflow is surplus based on what you do.

Future cashflow is surplus based on what you own.

### Three Types of Cashflow

When you see most people talk about cashflow, they’re usually talking about passive income (I call this “un-earned” income). There are many categories of cashflow.

Here are the top 3:

### Earned

Earned cashflow is the simplest. You work, and then you get paid. If you are a professional consultant, or a coach, or even a service provider — the type of cashflow you’re collecting is typically earned cashflow. If you stopped working then you stop getting paid. Now, you can definitely create leverage in your earned cashflow (and you should).

When we take clients and work with them hands-on, we’re usually doing things that create LEVERAGE in their business. If you have no leverage, you might be charging hourly (aka 1 hour = 1 unit of pay). When you create leverage, you sever the “time for money” equation and you can get paid for things that are not linear (aka 1 hour = 10 units of pay). An example of this would be products or productized consulting. This product, for instance, is very likely sold out (or at least sold out of its initial allotment) and I collected a disproportionate amount of capital than what time was put into it.

### Unearned

Un-earned cashflow is passive cashflow. There are “phases” inside of our Wealthy Consultant model. Every month and quarter, a small allotment of clientele come in and we begin taking them through our flagship “Phases.” Once you get to Phase III, we start developing “asset strategies” for your surplus cash. In Phase I you’re focused on getting dependable results and consistent business. In Phase II you’re focused on building a team and create leverage (leveraged earned cashflow). You also build a base of cash reserves in Phase II that can be used to deploy safely into your business.

In Phase III, we want your surplus cash flow to begin multiplying instead of sitting in a bank account. Safety & protection is good, but after a certain point, you must let your money work for you. If I put $100,000 into a piece of real estate and the markets do well, that $100,000 could turn into $150,000 in a few years. It did so without my involvement and without my effort — this is why it’s called “un-earned” cashflow: I did nothing to earn it.

### Borrowed

Borrowed cashflow is the type of increase that comes from productively using things you do not own (Debt, Partnerships, etc).

### There are 3 main kinds of leverage

There are three main kinds of leverage:

- Financial leverage (getting things you did not pay for)
- Operational leverage (getting things you did not work for)
- Distribution leverage (economies of scale & media)

The fourth kind of leverage is TIME. A unit of time invested into learning how to maximize the unit of time will be more profitable than the same unit of time invested into doing something else with that time. This is a cyclical loop (as you get smarter, you work less for same output).

To design our cashflow we want to first and foremost understand my definition of a financial moat: the difference between what’s possible at maximum velocity and what’s optimal.
