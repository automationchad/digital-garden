In [psychoanalytic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis "Psychoanalysis") literature, a **Madonna–whore complex**, also called a **Madonna–mistress complex**, is the inability to maintain sexual arousal within a committed, loving relationship.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madonna%E2%80%93whore_complex#cite_note-1) First identified by [Sigmund Freud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud "Sigmund Freud"), under the rubric of _psychic impotence_,[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madonna%E2%80%93whore_complex#cite_note-2) this [psychological complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_(psychology) "Complex (psychology)") is said to develop in men who see women as either saintly [Madonnas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_(mother_of_Jesus) "Mary (mother of Jesus)") or debased [prostitutes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitute "Prostitute"). Men with this behavioral complex desire a sexual partner who has been degraded (the whore) while they cannot desire the respected partner (the Madonna).[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madonna%E2%80%93whore_complex#cite_note-hartmann-3) Freud wrote: "Where such men love they have no desire and where they desire they cannot love."[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madonna%E2%80%93whore_complex#cite_note-4) [Clinical psychologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology "Clinical psychology") Uwe Hartmann, writing in 2009, stated that the complex "is still highly prevalent in today's patients".[[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madonna%E2%80%93whore_complex#cite_note-hartmann-3)
