**When to hire full-time employees:**

- People who are going to help you with the design of the business for long-term success
- People who are critical to the operation/delivery of the service
- When you want the speed, efficiency, and superior results that come with a team

**When to hire contractors:**

- When you need specialists
- When you want the financial flexibility of spinning up & down 
- When you have roles that don’t make sense as full-time because there’s not enough work to justify it
- When you have roles that you don’t expect to help you build the long-term future of the company but you need more short-term work
