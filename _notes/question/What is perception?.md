- “If the doors of perception were cleansed, everything would appear to man as it is infinite.” - _William Blake_
    
- **The Conundrum:** Perception – its intricate relationship with the mind, brain, consciousness, and reality – is something to ponder upon. How does perception even occur?
- After a two-week meditation retreat, Leo’s epiphany was that perception is an illusion. It doesn't exist in the way we've traditionally believed.
- **Perception Deconstructed:** It's not tied to biology or neurology. Sure, you can’t deny the raw data – the sounds, colors, and sensations. But perception is like an inwardly-painted snow globe. It's intertwined with metaphysical implications, necessitating both a subject and an object.
- **Ownerless Experience:** Without a perceiver, does the color red simply float in the vast emptiness? If both subject and object merge, can we label the result as 'experience'? Perhaps the universe is the ultimate experiencer.
- **Reimagining Reality:** Traditional thought posits an objective world, with distinct objects and sentient beings, and perceptions housed in our brains. But consider a different paradigm:
    1. There isn’t an objective external world. There's only a universal consciousness.
    2. You’re not an entity or a sentient being but an idea – the idea that you exist materially.
    3. Your perceived 'self' misinterprets this consciousness field, believing it's experiencing individual perceptions.
- **Deconstructing the Self:** Perceptions aren't bound to a 'self'. This shift in understanding is radical. There’s no biological entity, just a void or negative space in consciousness.
- **Unraveling Existence:** The external, material world that seemingly influences our perceptions never was. Reality is appearance. But your internal world isn’t real either. The raw data of existence remains constant; only the interpretation shifts. Perception equals Being plus Ego. Remove the ego, and you're left with pure Being.
- **A Sponge Analogy:** Think of a sponge with many cavities. You identify with one cavity, but you're actually the entire sponge. This realization is enlightenment, a merger of dichotomies.
- **Awareness without Living Creatures:** Awareness isn't a byproduct of life. In fact, labeling awareness as a 'thing' is already a misstep. It's a void, the space in which all exists.
- **The Brain and Perception:** The brain, seen as a central anchor, is but another perception. It doesn’t commandeer the reality we think it does.
- **The Path to Enlightenment:** This isn't abstract philosophy. It's achievable. With dedication to practices like meditation and contemplation, you can cleanse the doors of your perception, transcending your ego.
- **Concluding Thoughts:** Perceptions are interpretations. Without the sense of self, you perceive pure, absolute truth. The path to this understanding isn’t easy, but the enlightenment at its end offers unparalleled joy.
