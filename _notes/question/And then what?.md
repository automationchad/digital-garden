In a dusty corner of a Brazilian coastal town, a man in a suit found himself staring at the ocean, probably trying to calculate the net worth of the water. 

He spots a local, an old fisherman, pulling in a handsome catch.

He asks, "Hey there, how long'd it take to nab those?"

The fisherman looks up, eyes narrowed against the sun, "Not long."

"You could stick around, get some more of those," the suited man snickers.

"Got enough for today," the fisherman shrugs.

"And what now?" The businessman’s curiosity is almost genuine.

The fisherman, taking a drag from his cigarette, says, "Head back, mess around with my kids. Later, I'll have a nap with my lady. Nights? I drink with my mates. There’s some guitar, some singing. Life."

The businessman, with a smirk, leans in, "Listen, I studied this business shit. You could catch more, buy bigger boats, hell, start a company. Leave this dump, go to Sao Paulo. Maybe even hit the Stock Exchange. Make yourself a fortune."

The fisherman exhales, "How long?"

"Two decades, maybe?"

"And then what?"

The businessman grins, "Then? You retire. Get a nice place by the sea, wake up at dawn, fish a little, play with your kids, nap with your wife, drink with your pals at night. Bliss."

The fisherman, with a smirk of his own, takes another drag, "You mean, like I'm doing right now?"
